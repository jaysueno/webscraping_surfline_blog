       "  'The month of January isn’t exactly renowned for big south swells\\xa0– and given the\\xa0projected, surf-related impacts associated with this year’s La Nina,\\xa0you’d think we’re more likely to see a large swell arriving out of east or northeast.',\n",
       "  'The La Nina looks like coming back into play late this month.\\xa0In the meantime, we’re now on the cusp of a large and long-enduring run of South and SSE groundswell across the East Coast: its evolution following a long-wave trough amplifying over eastern Australian and NZ longitudes. Its evolution now manifesting a large, complex and quasi stationary low pressure system south to southeast of the Tasman Sea and NZ.',\n",
       "  'This broadscale low is working in conjunction with a big high pressure system migrating slowly eastward below the Bight:\\xa0collectively\\xa0supporting a vast SSW/SW fetch area that’s been responsible for the last three days of south swell across the\\xa0NSW coast.',\n",
       "  'Monday’s MSLP chart depicts the source: a vigorous frontal low now moving clear of Tasmania’s swell shadow and into our prime south-swell window. Source: BOM',\n",
       "  'However, we’re now seeing rapid acceleration in wave-growth inside our mid and long-range south swell windows;\\xa0invigorated by an intense frontal low south of Tasmania now merging with the parent system. A satellite pass captured a core, 50 to 60 knot SSW fetch on Monday – initially aimed at Victorian and Tasmanian targets.',\n",
       "  'This ASCAT image depicts core wind-speeds of 50-60 knots: the driving force behind several days of thumping south groundswell across the NSW coast. Source: NOAA',\n",
       "  'As the low marches further east over the next 24 hours\\xa0we’ll see the severe gale to storm force fetch expanding in size as it moves clear of Tasmania’s swell shadow and into our swell window.',\n",
       "  'Further, the system goes to work upon an already highly active sea-state, still evident in the wake of the leading area of low pressure that swept across the southern Tasman Sea over the weekend.\\xa0That lends high confidence for a peak in seas and swell in the 40-50ft range, occurring over the southern Tasman Sea, just below the 40S parallel on Tuesday morning.',\n",
       "  'Maximum seas and swell are projected to top out in the 40-50ft range on Tuesday, leading in an overnight peak in energy spilling over into Wednesday morning.',\n",
       "  'Keep in mind the bulk of the resulting SW groundswell emanating from this source is directed further north and east (ie at NZ and Fiji) – and there’s little doubt both locations will feel the brunt of exceptionally large swell-event in the days following. However, that still points to a large and powerful southerly groundswell moving up the NSW coast: ramping up across the South Coast from Tuesday morning, before really kicking in across Sydney and Newcastle during the afternoon. For Sydney and locations north, it’s looking like the bulk of energy will move in throughout the evening and overnight, leading in still large and powerful surf across the region on Wednesday morning.',\n",
       "  'True south-exposed breaks and deepwater reefs across Sydney can expect set waves nudging the 8-10ft+ range early on Wednesday morning, before levelling off at a still energetic 6-8ft+ during the day.\\xa0Newcastle and mid-northern NSW coasts\\xa0are likely to see slightly larger surf early, with the bulk of energy building in across mid to northern NSW coasts throughout the afternoon. Having said all that, it’s clear that a moderate onshore SSE flow will limit surfing options to the most sheltered nooks and crannies holding the swell, so plan accordingly.',\n",
       "  'Data from our new Lotus model depicts a peak in energy across Sydney and surrounds early on Wednesday.',\n",
       "  'The sheer size of the fetch area will deliver many days of powerful surf:\\xa0transitioning from a pretty straight southerly direction on Wednesday’s peak, to a more SSE angle of 160 to 170 degrees on Thursday and Friday. That should see an exceptional day of surf on the Thursday and a still large and powerful groundswell is greeted by early light NW winds, trending moderate to fresh NE into the afternoon. Likewise, Friday should also offer up another full day of great conditions favouring south-facing breaks under a continued north to NE wind-regime.',\n",
