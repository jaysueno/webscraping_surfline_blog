Its evolution now manifesting a large, complex and quasi stationary low pressure system south to southeast of the Tasman Sea and NZ."",""This broadscale low is working in conjunction with a big high pressure system migrating slowly eastward below the Bight: collectively supporting a vast SSW/SW fetch area that’s been responsible for the last three days of south swell across the NSW coast."",""Monday’s MSLP chart depicts the source: a vigorous frontal low now moving clear of Tasmania’s swell shadow and into our prime south-swell window.

For Sydney and locations north, it’s looking like the bulk of energy will move in throughout the evening and overnight, leading in still large and powerful surf across the region on Wednesday morning."",""True south-exposed breaks and deepwater reefs across Sydney can expect set waves nudging the 8-10ft+ range early on Wednesday morning, before levelling off at a still energetic 6-8ft+ during the day. Newcastle and mid-northern NSW coasts are likely to see slightly larger surf early, with the bulk of energy building in across mid to northern NSW coasts throughout the afternoon. Having said all that, it’s clear that a moderate onshore SSE flow will limit surfing options to the most sheltered nooks and crannies holding the swell, so plan accordingly."",""Data from our new Lotus model depicts a peak in energy across Sydney and surrounds early on Wednesday."",""The sheer size of the fetch area will deliver many days of powerful surf: transitioning from a pretty straight southerly direction on Wednesday’s peak, to a more SSE angle of 160 to 170 degrees on Thursday and Friday. That should see an exceptional day of surf on the Thursday and a still large and powerful groundswell is greeted by early light NW winds, trending moderate to fresh NE into the afternoon.

6006ae49349a6870be3cee26,RIP: Gordon James Philipson (1938-2021),"[""Quickly access the spots you care about most."",""Gordon Philipson, who has died aged 82, was a man of a different time, in both world affairs and in surfing."",""Born on the brink of WW2, he was already an adult by the time Australia’s Baby Boom generation discovered surfing. While many of them defined their lives through the classic surfing ideal of freedom, this graceful gentle man defined himself by a different vision: service."",""Gordon was raised in a big Queensland family, one of 11 children, and became a boilermaker by trade, working for a while on the Cudgen sand mining projects in northern NSW. He developed a love of big fast cars early in life, and hung on to a very ’50s Elvis slick-back hair look that should have put him on the wrong side of the fabled Coolangatta surfie/rocker wars of the 1960s. Instead he was an original member of Snapper Rocks Surfriders’ Club, and his scary Ford Customline V8 became the go-to vehicle for surf trips up and down the coast."",""Peter Townend recalls surfing at Greenmount with Gordon. After a surf PT and his original surfing mate Al Miscamble would hang out in the carpark next to Gordon’s Ford, listening to Glenn Campbell’s “Galveston” on the radio. “To this day whenever I hear that song it reminds me of the friendship with Gordon for the next 50 plus years,” says PT. “I played my vinyl copy on the turntable on the day I heard of his passing."",""The 1974 Qld team, Gordon front and centre. Note the original Coolie kids, MP, Bugs and PT, along with numerous others"",""“He took so many of us on our first surf trips, mine was a first trip to Noosa with MP in the Ford where the surf was perfect, he dropped MP and I at the National Park entrance where we walked around to Ti Tree to surf pretty much by ourselves while Gordo went back to Johnson’s to surf his favourite spot in the world.”"",""On another trip, Gordon’s boilermaker skills came in even handier than his driving skills. This was a big hike across to Western Australia with great mate Graeme “Blackie” Black and John Sims, both Snapper superstars of the ’60s. They surfed a bit and were on the way back, near a town called Kimba in South Australia, when the car’s motor failed."",""John’s parents sent him money for the trip home, but Gordon and Blackie were stuck in Kimba. According to Graeme, Gordon’s trade got him plenty of work fixing harvesters in that wheat country, but it took them two months to earn enough to buy a new motor. Once they had though, “the townspeople didn’t want Gordon to go. He was such a top bloke, they appreciated the person he was, and were really devastated to see him go.” Like we said, different times."",""In similar fashion, organised surfing in Australia back then was very far from the tightly operated business it is today. Local and State competitions relied on a handful of volunteers who typically stepped up from a club to run things as best they could. Gordon stepped up from Snapper Rocks to the Queensland branch of the Australian Surfing Association. By 1970 he was heading up the organisation, just as Queensland’s incredible first Coolie-kid talent surge was about to begin."",""The ASAQ was run by pencil, paper and home phone, but it ran like clockwork. The contests rolled out by Gordon and his team gave thousands of younger surfers a sense of structure and belonging at a critical time in their lives. The great Sunny Coast surfer Jody Perry, a frothing grom at the time, put it beautifully in a recent tribute to Gordon: “We all saw him and the other administrators (Eric Aberdeen, Barry Townend, Eric Cowley, Bushy Mitchell, and Gordon) as father figures. Beautiful people that we all looked up to. It was like we all had five dads.”"",""Coolie’s Kerry Gill recalls an ASAQ trip in 1972, when he and five other Queensland junior champs, including Rabbit and Dave McDonald, were sent to Sydney to compete in the Australian Schoolboys champs at Maroubra. Gordon organised the lot, including pre-trip photos on the plane steps, high style accommodation, and tickets to Luna Park with 200 free rides. “It was our first big trip away from a relatively still sleepy Gold Coast …. we were treated like young Hollywood stars. Unfortunately in true Queensland style we ran amok (in Luna Park) and were kicked off every ride."",""Coolie royalty: Wayne Deane, Joe Larkin, Gordon, and Barry Townend at a ASAQ 40th anniversary dinner. All are now passed away."",""“When we returned to Coolangatta after the trip of a lifetime thinking what’s Gordo goin’ to say, we were simply met with a gentle, ‘I’m glad to see you all back safely.’”"",""Gordon spent some time supporting national ASA president Brian Austen in the late 1970s, while Brian struggled with illness. Eventually for a time he took on the role of president of both organisations at once, assisted by PT’s dad Barry, who became a lifelong friend."",""He spent a lot of time coaching people in the art of running these shows, which believe it or not, didn’t come naturally to everyone.  Robert “Bushy” Mitchell was one such student: “I listened and watched Gordon in action at meetings and events, it was an apprenticeship in learning administration skills but more importantly people skills. Gordon would offer advice, just quietly on the side … all with a minimum of fuss. He also taught me just to take care of the situation at hand: sort the problem, look for a solution. He got a huge kick out of seeing the younger generation of surfers doing well.”"",""In 2019 with PT."",""Among the numerous life memberships of surf organisations, in the 1970s Gordo was offered one by North Shore Boardriders. He’d made the club trophies and presented them for a number of years. Gordo declined the honour at the time, saying it might present an appearance of favouritism, but last year he accepted. To present it, Bushy Mitchell went to visit him in his Kirra apartment: “We called into his flat and he was tickled pink. Duly had an ale and a good yarn — checked out his Corvette in the garage, with recently added side exhausts. We even went down into Coolangatta to get a pie.”"",""Later, “Gordon pulled from behind the couch a Wayne Deane board — dusting it off, he said he had to get back in nick to have a wave or two.”"",""Gordon never married. He is survived by eight of his 10 siblings, and numerous nieces and nephews."",""–"",""(Thanks to PT, Bushy, Kerry Gill and Jody Perry for their help with this piece.)"",""Get ready, the East Coast is about to rumble."",""Ten Things from Surfing & the Internet on the Week That Was January 15 2021"",""The Most Core Surf Comp of the Year"",""With Sunset cancelled, Nick Carroll assesses the obstacles facing the WSL's planned restart in Australia"",""Helicopter footage of the biggest day of the year"",""Featuring XXL Jaws, Oahu's Outer Reefs and Waimea Bay""]",[]

More world-class pointbreaks than they could cross-step on — plus Cuervo’s iconic spirit to pass around the post-surf campfire, so they could ride that wave of fun into the night. Thus, surfers not only brought home stories of leg-burning Mexican pointbreaks, but also bottles of Cuervo to share with their friends."",""The relationship stuck, and by the late ‘70s, Cuervo dove in and sponsored a major pro surfing comp at Sunset Beach. The invitees were a who’s who of legendary surf celebs, like Shaun Tomson, Dane Kealoha, Michael Ho and Rabbit Bartholomew. And to make things even more rad, the Cuervo Classic Surfing Championship offered the biggest prize purse of any event at the time — something the first Cuervo Classic champ, Shaun Tomson, was surely psyched about."",""1978 Cuervo Classic Surfing Championships.

But then it widened and spit right over that channel section!”"",""“That wave actually changed my entire mindset of how I rode barrels. I specifically remember thinking, ‘I’m not gonna make this wave, but I’m just gonna hang on to my board, instead of falling safely or getting into a safer situation,’ and then all a sudden, I came flying out. From then on, it was like, ‘maybe I should just do that every time I think I’m gonna fall or not make it,’ you know?”"",""“I don’t surf expecting to get the best waves, but I’ve been wanting this my whole life. I remember looking at this wave as if it were maybe a closeout, but as I got to the bottom, I noticed that it was throwing real hard so I was like, ‘Wow, this is really beautiful!.’ The next thing I know I’m going faster and faster, the foamball hits the bottom of my board and projects me forward and shot me out. That’s what I live for, those moments.”"",""“That was a special wave for me. To win WOTW is a pretty hard task, right? It was definitely a unique wave.

For instance, with no heat schedule, there’s more room for competitors. And more competitors means more opportunity for some unknowns to storm in and shakeup the established brass. And again, with no typical heat schedule, surfers can catch their best two waves over the course of a month versus a 30-minute window (or whatever) – meaning the freesurf format ups the performance level wayyy higher than a normal event."",""“I think the virtual format has been such a cool new way to look at the venues,” said Dane Gudauskas, who has been utilizing the unique format to experiment with some trippy surfboard designs. “It really allows for everyone to look for the exact windows of swell, wind, and tide at each spot they want to tap into. Plus, the swell has been nonstop at all three spots, so it’s been a marathon of surfing. I love how this new format engages you every day in what the swells are doing and, as a viewer, getting to look forward to new clips has to be incredible, too.”"",""So, while we long for the days of the last-minute hail marys for CT qualification at Sunset Beach, the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing has managed to make some damn fine Mai Tais out of sour lemons. Keep scrolling for more on how the event works, who’s been looking good ahead of the event window’s close, and what the athletes think."",""First of all, the same trio of spikes shape the three-pointed crown – Haleiwa, Pipeline, and Sunset Beach. All participating surfers must submit their best two waves from each spot. From there, the waves will be judged by three WSL judges, each scoring it out of 10, for a total of 30 points per wave. At the end, there will be winners – both male and female – from each event (spot), and an overall Triple Crown winner with the highest total score from all three spots (also, both male and female)."",""Make sense? Good."",""Well, it’s kinda happening at all times since waves can be ridden and considered for scores from any time during the “waiting period.” But here’s some specifics:"",""The event window lasts from December 21, 2020 through January 15, 2021. The first two submissions for each competitor must be submitted by 8pm (HST), no later than the following day that the wave was ridden."",""There’s the usual suspects, of course.

Here’s a few thoughts:"",""Nate Florence: “I think this format allows the surfers to put more into the waves, surf riskier waves, and go bigger than if they were in a heat surfing. You have the full session, and you can really give each wave 100% effort…not surfing ‘safely’ to get a score. It’s a freesurf combined with the competitive mindset in these sessions…and that makes it really fun.”"",""Wyatt McHale: “The virtual format is really awesome because it opens up the Triple Crown to a much more diverse group of surfers. People that might not be able to get into the events in previous years are given a chance to showcase their skills with the new digital format."",""“It also allows the surfers to be much freer in their approach to Haleiwa, Sunset, and Pipe. In a heat sometimes you have to bring your level of surfing down a bit to make sure you are completing waves and getting scores. With the virtual format, the surfers are free to go as big as possible on every wave in hopes of nailing a really good clip. Some surfers will definitely benefit more than others from the virtual format.”"",""Dane Gudauskas: “The level of surfing has been mind-blowing.

Maybe not “eventful” in the sense of pro surfing events, or surfing trade shows, or anything else you might call an “event” in a normal 12 months. But as far as weird, sad, illuminating and unexpected events, as far as actual non-events, and as far as fantastic and spectacular surf sessions at home and in places you couldn’t go for the first time in a generation — as far as all that goes, 2020 was a full on bell-ringer. 2021 will be a different matter, maybe in the coming year we’ll see what survived 2020 for real and what didn’t … but meanwhile, here’s a look at some of the stuff that made surfing news in the time of Covid."",""2019 Pipe Masters. Photo: Jeremiah Klein"",""The World Surf League had plans, and they were good plans. The pro scene was coming off a strong year, with a great finale at Pipe and popular champs in Italo and Carissa, and they had all this stuff planned and ready to go, including what seemed like a serious building block strategy around a new qualifying super-tier called the Challenger Series. They were about halfway through the first Challenger Series event of the year, in Sydney, Australia, when the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. While many things then seemed to happen very quickly, the WSL couldn’t bring itself to give up on such good plans, and it took until mid-July for the tour to be officially clamped in 2020. Ironically, by then a bunch of other pro sports were off and running again. Also by then, the rest of us were surfing our brains out."",""Olympic surfing site: Shidashita, Japan. Photo: Pedro Gomes"",""Everybody was excited! Well a lot of people were, that’s for sure. The Tokyo Summer Olympics were coming, and at long last surfing was in on the game. Fortunes had been spent — why, the Australian and US teams had put down close to a million bucks between them in hotel reservations alone. Olympic surfing had been a dream of the world’s organized surfing community for, what, almost 60 years? Would this be the Great Leap Forward for which so many of them had hoped? Could the shape of the sport be about to change forever? Well the answer to that last question would turn out to be Yes, but not because of the Olympics. Tokyo was an early casualty of the plague. By late March the plug had been pulled, all those reservations were postponed, and the great Dream was on the backburner once again."",""San Diego beaches closed in May. Photo: Billy Watts"",""Surfers around the world were then confronted with a baffling inconsistency. In some places, you were allowed to surf, in others, you totally weren’t, and nobody was completely sure why. Nobody even knew if the plague could survive salt water, much less a good cutback — though Kim Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps, sent everyone into a spin by declaring a good cutback might just infect you. Prather later claimed to have been mis-quoted, of course, but that didn’t stop beaches from Lowers to Bondi being shut down in a better safe than sorry sorta way, which in turn didn’t stop people from trying to surf them in a screw-you-it’s-pumping sorta way. Over time, sanity prevailed, the shackles loosened, and by mid-year almost everywhere was open slather once more. But we should spare a thought for the crew at Jeffreys Bay, who by Christmas were still being arrested just for checking the surf."",""Orders on orders at Album Surfboards in November. Photo: Billy Watts"",""But by the middle of 2020, despite the panic and the beach shutdowns and the vanishing world tour and all the rest, it became clear that surfing was in the midst of an unexpected and completely unforecasted boom. Like, crazy kind. There was a moment in late March, when amid talk of a coming Depression, a lot of boardmakers and surf shops braced themselves for disaster. A month later, they were trying to find new staff to cope with demand from the floods of semi-employed and very bored people who wanted to do what seemed like one of the few things they were actually allowed to do, without a mask on at least. Global wetsuit sales doubled, and city lineups everywhere were super-packed, unless of course it was overhead, in which case it was only very packed. And as the year rolled on, nothing changed, except half the surf hard-goods industry ran out of stock."",""Photo: Jeremiah Klein"",""Sadly, one area of surfer employment didn’t fare as well as wetsuits and surfboards. Surf travel, like all kinds of travel, got a beating. There wasn’t a whole lot of relief from surfing’s sudden popularity, either, because nobody could go anywhere. OK perhaps that is not entirely true. Almost nobody could go anywhere, but some people could go somewhere, if they trod lightly and didn’t rattle any local cages (see: Shane Dorian on Mexico). And a very few people could go pretty much where and when they wanted, at least if they chose the moment. Maybe the best performance in this genre came from none other than the Goat Himself, Kelly. Slater spent the first three months of the plague roaming up and down the east coast of Australia during its best fall season in a decade — then in September, found a loophole into Bali and spent two months getting barreled during the mellowest Indo winter this century. It’s good to be the King."",""Summer in the Maldives. Photo: Richard Kotch"",""Then there were the surfers who were already somewhere, and couldn’t leave. Stuck! In places like Bali! And Fiji!! And the bloody Maldives. You could even argue that Kelly’s international year began after he was trapped in Australia following the collapse of the WSL’s Challenger Series event in New Zealand, where he’d been hailed as the star attraction. Perhaps the ultimate tragedy of this very 2020 dilemma was Anthony Fillingim of Costa Rica, who found himself trapped in Kandui Resort in the northern Mentawais, during a run of surf so impossibly perfect it’s hard to imagine how the poor man will be able go on with any kind of surfing life from this point. Like — how do you top that?"",""Davey Cathels late May. Photo: Matt Dunbar"",""No wonder Kelly stuck around. The advent of Covid-19 heralded the Aussie east coast’s best six months of surf this century. First the Queensland and northern NSW pointbreaks went on a major tear, with Burleigh, Currumbin and the Superbank absolutely firing through the fall months for weeks on end — super enhanced for the locals when Queensland shut its borders to everyone else in the world, including the rest of Australia. Then as winter arrived, the coasts south of there joined the party, big time. Around the Sydney area, it was so big, so consistently, for so long that you might have been forgiven for thinking some sort of nuclear weapons were being deployed somewhere offshore. And like so much of 2020’s great surf, the best of it belonged to the locals — like underground charger Chris Lougher, who rode the best wave anyone’s ever seen ridden in that massive surf town. You couldn’t go to Indo, but maybe this was better."",""Conor Maguire, Ireland, October 28th. Photo: Conor Flanagan / Red Bull Content Pool"",""No sooner had the Australian surf binge kinda settled than the whole North Atlantic Ocean began spinning in mad counter clockwise circles. The US East Coast was first in line, sure, but when the hurricanes went extra-tropical and pointed at that ocean’s opposing shores, things got real serious. In Ireland, the local crew had to work around a lockdown, gaining permission to surf from local authorities before Conor Maguire was allowed to chase down a wave we suspect not even the virus could have survived. The same swell was more telegraphed at Nazare, Portugal, where the usual suspects went triple-XL in the cleanest conditions you’ll ever see when 80-foot waves are breaking. But even this old fishing town, whose economy was saved by its unexpectedly hosting the tallest surf on earth, couldn’t avoid the impact of Covid-19; regional health authorities put a ban on any kind of surfing at Praia do Norte, because dammit, surfing’s just too popular! Too many people show up to watch!"",""Peter Mel, Mav’s, Dec. 8th. Photo: Billy Watts"",""It fell out of the sky. Not even the crew who flew halfway across the Pacific to score it expected anything this good. By all accounts, from the oddly calming video to the “how insane was that!” type commentary from the exhausted crew at the boat ramp on dusk, Tuesday, December 8th was the day everyone who’s ever surfed Mav’s has been waiting for this whole time. Super clean, powerful, chipping in from the outer takeoff, wind, tide and swell cooperating all the way. Like Grant “Twiggy” Baker said later: “If you wanted a big one, you could get it.” And when big Pete Mel, who’s been surfing the joint every which way for over 25 years, got the best wave of the day, one of the great themes of 2020 was reinforced. At Mav’s, as it was pretty much everywhere, this was the Year of the Local."",""Photo: Jeremiah Klein"",""When 56-year-old Maui surfer Robin Warren died after being attacked by a large tiger shark in shallow water at Honolua Bay in December, it was a grim punctuation mark on an even grimmer sentence for 2020. At least seven surfers were killed, and many more injured, in unprovoked shark attacks through the year, leaving more questions than ever to be answered about our relationship with the great predator. We still don’t really know why attacks sometimes happen and why sometimes they don’t; there’s enough drone footage around now of large sharks cruising harmlessly within easy range of us to know it’s not as simple as killing them first. The only thing not in question has been the courage of our fellow surfers, who time after time in 2020, showed a willingness to go toward danger and haul the victim out, no matter the risk to themselves. Maybe, in that sense, we’re our own best protection."",""Ocean City, New Jersey during Hurricane Teddy in September. Photo: Pat Nolan"",""El Niño, La Niña. When it comes to the great climate cycle, you’re either on one side or the other, and as the 2020 Atlantic tropical storm season arrived more or less in sync with the Little Girl, everyone from the Caribbean to Maine knew what side they were on. It seemed like late September’s Teddy was the favorite, feeding pretty much every exposed Atlantic coastline with something worthy of the name “hurricane swell”, but in the busiest hurricane season since they began taking notes, Teddy was not exactly alone. And in the way of such seasons, things kept happening into the cold months, with a gorgeous December nor-easter elevating many a surfers’ barrel count. In a year when you couldn’t escape whatever Fate your local spot dished up, this great season seemed like another gift from the surfing gods."",""Justine Dupont.

Maya’s wave was actually deemed the biggest of anybody’s, regardless of gender, which might have seemed super appropriate in this year of women ripping, except for the fact that another woman heartily disagreed. Justine Dupont’s ride at the same location earned her Ride of the Year, but she reckoned she was ripped off for Biggest Wave, declaring herself “deeply hurt”, “disappointed and ashamed of this league which claims to represent our sport.” Whew!

In July, just as the 2020 season was shuttered, they opened up an audacious plan for 2021: a complete CT re-fit, beginning with the Pipe Masters in December ’20, and culminating in September ’21 with a one-day top five world champ shootout, at a then-undisclosed location. It was news, but hardly a secret; the League had been bouncing the idea around since 2017, and WSL owner Dirk Ziff was a big fan. Trouble was, at this point the WSL CT didn’t functionally exist, and the whole amazing surf Boom of 2020 was rolling along just fine without it — most of us were way more interested in what the next swell would look like, and how we could talk our shaper buddy into pushing our next board out before Christmas. Would the WSL be able to pull off these plans in 2021 — and would we paying attention again by then? Time will tell."",""Surf and shaper Ryan Burch of Ryan Burch Surfboards.

But by the back half of 2020, nobody was complaining any more. There wasn’t enough time to complain. There wasn’t enough time in the day. Surfboard demand, thanks to the Covid Surfing Boom, had exceeded supply for the first time this century, and it included everybody: softboard suppliers, importers, custom guys, blankmakers, glass shops, the big names, everyone. Materials were put under even more pressure with the unexpected shutdown of a couple of key chemical plants in Germany, threatening the supply of PU foam — and though that crisis seems to have passed, if you got a custom board within two months of ordering it in 2020, count yourself lucky."",""Erin Brooks, Waco, TX.

It began in January with what seemed like a wholesale massacre of the Hurley superteam at the hands of the label’s new and very non-core owners; the massacre was later revealed to be an over-call, but then the Covid set in, the contests and their prizemoney were canceled, and the contracts began to wither on the vine. Let’s face it — how do you showcase your brilliance without a world tour for a stage? And when you can’t just go do clips in the Ments? Truth is while some tour pros enjoyed the unexpected year off, others may have lost a critical career year to the Covid.

Modern surfing was a total grommet in 1960, when John Severson started up Surfer magazine. Almost exactly 60 years later, this past October, when the current trademark owners unceremoniously shut the mag, it came as a shock, but not that much of a shock. The world over which Surfer magazine held cultural sway for so long was a different place — one in which surfers waited a month for news from home and abroad, where surf movies took three years to shoot and a year to show, where a single great photograph might engrave itself on the collective surfing memory, not for days but for years. By 2020, when surfers can insta-check their favorite spot via remote live-cam, and surf stars send you daily updates on their magnificent lives via social media, those days were long gone. But you know what, you can still look at the back issues."",""Photo: Shutterstock/John Carnemolla"",""It began in late 2019, when Nat Young’s fabled Country Soul property in Nymboida, NSW, was burned to the ground, along with some of the best-ridden surfboards in history. But that was just the start. By the end of January 2020, half the Australian east coast had been put to the torch in the country’s worst ever fire season. Millions or acres and billions of animals, including 173 humans, were incinerated, and numerous surfing lives permanently altered by the blazes; to this day, when you approach some of the coast’s best remote reefs, you’ll do so through dead blackened stumps. The Black Summer only came to its true end when the great storms of fall brought the rain and surf that would herald this same coast’s epic winter."",""Photo: WSL/Heff"",""Was this a sign of normal service being resumed? If so, well, normal service isn’t quite what we thought it was. After months of planning and negotiation, the WSL got its major league rolling again in late November with the Maui Pro presented by Roxy. It all looked normal enough — waiting period, swell arrives, small but pretty Honolua Bay — until the terrible shark attack on Robin Warren drove the finals away from Maui and into limbo. Segue to Pipe, where again things looked normal enough, if you could ignore the absence of any spectators — until the astonishing news broke of WSL CEO Erik Logan being struck down by Covid-19. No, in the year of the Plague, nothing was destined to be normal — though the fact that somehow both these events were concluded without further bizarre incident has to count for something. If they can just keep their hands clean enough to get the next event at Sunset Beach done, the WSL’s 2021 might just happen after all."",""Elite chargers on what to expect during this unprecedented Northern Hemisphere winter"",""A BTS look at the new South Korea location with founder, Josema Odriozola"",""\""You can usually stop people from dying with very basic equipment and very simple techniques.\"""",""Several weeks in, people are surfing and the Thing ain’t spreading.

For many zones on the East Coast, December delivered rounds of solid surf as the weather pattern aligned to keep a steady flow of fronts and storms moving through the coast (and colder air temps for Florida and portions of the Southeast). With La Nina set in place for winter, though, we’re more likely to end up with average or below-average surf for the next three months. Is there any hope for something exceptional to come along and buck the normal trend of La Nina surf? Sure, there’s always hope when you’re dealing with the ocean and the atmosphere.

The most powerful nor’easter of the past few winters delivered solid surf to the Mid Atlantic and Northeast around the key dates (14th-17th) that we’d identified in the Best Bets at the start of the month. Another storm sent really good surf to New Jersey on the 22nd — then New England, where our target date was the 21st (pretty dang close for a call made three-weeks out).

Much of those states’ surf came from the active frontal storm track. Our key dates matched up pretty well, but the wave source and swell period were off. South Florida, however, came out an unexpected winner with a couple of fun N swells (8th-9th and Christmas Day) and a few other rideable days mixed in. West Florida had a good run, as well, with nearly a third of the month offering rideable surf.

No one could’ve. Retailers around the world shuttered their doors while following shelter-in-place orders, forcing them to cancel new orders and making it harder to sell any existing stock they had. Record unemployment and beach closures and/or restrictions around the country certainly didn’t offer any peace of mind."",""Matt Parker’s shaping bay.

This begs the question: Why has the boardbuilding industry seen so much positive growth during this pandemic?"",""A big factor has been the influx of new surfers. With team sports put on hold and gyms temporarily closed, young beginners and adult learners alike turned to surfing as a socially distant, fun exercise. Patrik Schmidle, the President of ActionWatch, a firm that collects industry data for surf shops and brands across the United States and Australia, has been closely monitoring how the pandemic has affected sales at core surf shops. ActionWatch’s own data saw an almost perfect V-shaped recovery from the nearly 80% decline in store sales back in March and April. The growth rate for surf hardgoods (surfboards, leashes, fins, etc.) quadrupled from 25% in February all the way up to 113% in June, and has been growing steadily ever since."",""Album orders.

Boardbuilders everywhere are logging more hours in shaping bays and glass factories than ever before — as canceled surf trips, less nights out, and yes, unemployment and stimulus money have left many surfers with extra cash for a new stick — or a new quiver. This, combined with an army of eager beginners and more open schedules due to remote work, has led to an unexpected increase in surfboard sales. And while more business is usually a good thing, particularly during these uncertain times, some shapers are struggling to keep up with the new demand."",""Britt Merrick, head shaper and co-owner of Channel Islands Surfboards, said that their boards have been selling out as soon as they hit the racks. Britt’s even gone so far as to tell customers not to waste their time hunting down a stock board and to place an order for a custom instead, and even then, it’ll take longer. A few weeks, maybe more. Meanwhile, those delays trickle down the entire production line."",""Britt Merrick. Photo: Billy Watts"",""“The bottleneck to keeping up with all the orders we have is the glassing,” said Britt. “The results of these changes to our production flow, combined with a never-before-seen demand for boards, has all fallen squarely on the shoulders of our glassers and sanders. There is a considerable amount of labor that goes into every board we build. And when you’re focused on quality, you can’t just rush them through.”"",""Read: Nick Carroll on Australia’s blank and material shortage"",""Like every other shaper we talked to, Jon Pyzel of Pyzel Surfboards obviously sympathizes with those negatively impacted by the coronavirus, but he’s also keenly aware of how the windfall has favored not only his business, but the surfboard manufacturing industry as a whole. “It’s not like I’m stoked about COVID at all,” said Jon, “but it definitely improved our business to a certain degree, and I think that’s across the board.”"",""Jon Pyzel.

Hell, we’re not even talking about a crisp, virgin blade off the rack of your local surf shop. What we are talking about is a custom surfboard, ordered and shaped with your size, ability, local conditions and whatever other modifications you can think of in mind."",""Sound scary? Overwhelming? Well it can be. Luckily for you, we enlisted the help of four experts – Jason Bennett of Chemistry Surfboards, Xanadu of Xanadu Surfboards, Matt Parker of Album Surfboards and Jon Pyzel of Pyzel Surfboards – to get you started on the right track."",""Have you seen more first-time custom board orders since COVID?"",""Jason Bennett: I’ve been noticing all the online orders are big boards, like big fishes and big mid-lengths and eggs. So it’s like for sure the first hardboard, pretty much every order that’s coming in on our online store is like their first custom surfboard."",""Xanadu: For my business, I don’t get that much of that because I’m not really a flashy brand, I focus more on the core surfers. For beginners to get to my brand, they’re going to have to ask around a lot, like another good surfer and a good surfer is going to tell them that that’s a good brand. I see them in the water because I’ve been going surfing, you see all those people in the water now, but I don’t get so much of those customers."",""Matt Parker: I mean we’ve always kinda built boards direct to consumer where people have always come to us directly and so much of our business is custom boards anyways. I haven’t seen any of those people changing that because that was already our customer base. So maybe some of those are new to that experience but that’s always kind of been the people we’ve worked with to make boards for, so I haven’t, I haven’t noticed anything different there."",""Jon Pyzel: I get a lot of, “Hey I want to get my first shortboard,” it’s a lot of people that are transitioning. They can ride soft tops, they can ride longboards or whatever they’ve been on that has led to all of them surfing more often. That just leads them into, “I’m getting better, so I’m going to get off my Wavestorm and I want to get a real board.” I get a lot of that."",""Looking for a freshie?"",""What advice do you have for people ordering their first custom?"",""Jason Bennett: To be honest about their ability, how long they’ve been surfing and not to be afraid of keeping the volume up. Cause a lot of people are like, I’ve been on the soft top, but they’re at the beach and they, you know, they see kids or they see people with short boards or fishes and you know, they want to look cool, but they’re going to struggle on it."",""Xanadu: My advice would be to go wider, similar to a foam board. A more wider nose and rounder tail that planes pretty good. I want these people to stand up on a wave because beginner or intermediate surfers have trouble generating speed."",""Matt Parker: I would say be realistic, don’t order something based on what your favorite surfer’s riding or what the market tells you. So many people ride boards and miss the mark if they’re more concerned about what it looks like walking down the beach versus what it can do for them out in the water. I’ve always felt this view of like what are you actually doing on the wave? Are you working a bottom turn? Top turn? A combination? Are you trying to get more progressive with what you’re surfing and what you’re doing? Get a board that can accentuate what you’re already doing better and that’s gonna allow you to have more fun."",""Jon Pyzel: If you’re ordering your first custom you’re already on a shortboard or a normal board, just use that as a reference, that’s already easier you’re like, “Oh you already ride like a 6’6’’ or something,” and then you’re like what are those dimensions, then figure it out from there."",""What mistakes do beginners make when ordering a surfboard for the first time?"",""Jason Bennett: They want to jump real quick. The soft tops are really easy to surf, they’re easy to paddle, there is a lot of stability in them so you’re already going to feel a huge difference once you go to this egg that’s polyester that doesn’t have all that float."",""Xanadu: Sometimes when a beginner starts surfing on a fiberglass board made of fiberglass and foam they can get hurt and so people kind of stop because they got hurt at the very beginning. With the foam boards, that won’t happen."",""Matt Parker: Well, people definitely nowadays get really hung up on volume numbers. Like they come in and they think I ride 29 liters, so I need to get this board. It needs to be 29 liters. And I mean, volume is a helpful number, but there’s other elements and variables that go into whether it’s going to work for you or whether it’s the right board for you."",""Jon Pyzel: The worst thing is to get a board and all of a sudden surfing’s not fun, now you can’t catch waves or everything gets worse. Their dreams are like: ‘Oh I wanna rip,’ but the reality is like you have to build up to that and just to make sure that you get the transition board that will help them to be able to kind of continue that journey.

And then there’s some people who surf every day no matter what. I’d say it’s pretty diverse, but all around there’s a really good vibe. The perfect week would include surfing, drinking lots of coffee, hiking the local mountains, and dinner parties with good food and wine.”"",""“There’s something special about getting fun waves with your mates,” she adds. “The surf doesn’t necessarily need to be good, but just being out there having a yarn and a giggle brings a lot of joy. And going really fast or riding a super-silky wave makes me smile, too.”"",""Transferring her dreams of becoming a professional gymnast to the ocean, the driven yet fun-loving young lady started surfing at the age of 13 and got her breakthrough result in the U18 division of the 2015 Australian Titles, where she placed 3rd. That provided a platform for a Pro Juniors berth in 2016, and even after finishing 4th overall on the Australasian rankings that year, Tori was already questioning her career path."",""Taking a year off from competition in 2017, Tori got exactly the inspiration she needed as she committed herself to a steady process of self-reflection, working, training and surfing. Self-funding her travels by working as a lifeguard in her hometown of Noosa, Tori has never been afraid to roll up her sleeves and work hard to get what she wants. Unsurprisingly, not only did her surfing improve during this time, but her competitive desire also returned — with a vengeance. With visions of powerful reefbreaks that suit her approach (progressive surfing in bigger waves) dancing in her head, the 22-year-old set her sights on the WSL Women’s Championship Tour."",""By 2018, the newfound passion was evident. Tori traveled to Indonesia and won an unprecedented three QS events back to back. Those victories provided all the impetus she needed to climb high enough on the rankings to compete in the QS6000 events in 2019. But then… 2020 happened and adjustments had to be made. Events got canceled and Tori’s visions of qualifying for the Dream Tour were put on ice. But, like she’d done in 2017, Tori simply used the time away from the contest singlet to indulge a new passion: riding a multitude of different surf craft at home."",""“I’ve usually stuck to high-performance shortboards in all conditions,” she explains. “But there are times where you lose some froth when repeatedly aiming for three to the beach. I’ve been largely influenced by my friends around me in Noosa; as they constantly switch it up between a longboard, fish, single-fin, finless, surf mat… you name it. Curiosity came into play, and since then I’ve been trying to experiment a little more. I find it so impressive when someone can bring a bunch of different boards down to the beach and adjust their surfing so seamlessly.”"",""“I’ve been surfing my 5’2” twinny a lot,” she continues. “Then, when the points line up, I’ve got this biscuit Bonzer, which is the fastest board I have ever surfed. I’ve also jumped on a friend’s 6’6” single-fin a few times, and I’ve tried out some stretched-out, old-school shortboards, as well. And of course, a foamy log or mid-length soft-top is an essential on the Sunshine Coast.”"",""As the year unfolded, a newfound joy simmered to the surface for Vittoria, and she became rather comfortable with the pivot she had to make. “This year was a really nice reset for me,” she explains. “What would usually be a pretty packed year of contests and travel turned into a year spent laying low at home. There were a few weeks where work was slim, but it just happened to be one of the best years of waves on the coast. I spent a lot of time surfing and hanging with some close friends.”"",""However, the aspirations remained, and Tori has written and rewritten her goals multiple times throughout 2020. And without a major sponsor taking pride of place on the nose of her surfboard, she’s started to question the competitive route altogether. “If travel is permitted next year, I will immediately be booking a surf trip to find some quality waves,” she laughs. “I’m not sure if that’s wishful thinking, but there is a whole lot more I’m itching to see in the world. I’m hoping next year will enable me to collect some more stamps in my passport. I definitely lost a bit of competitive fire during 2020. I love surfing and I love trying to be better at it every day… I just don’t think I want to go down that competitive route.”"",""While Tori never landed that headline sponsor from a surf apparel company during this tough economic time, she was fortuitously picked up by a surf accessories business that lines up with where she’s headed. “I am so happy to have connected with RYD this year,” she says. “It has really put some pep in my step to have a company backing me for being me. Their values really lined up with mine at a time when I was questioning the competitive side. They focus a lot on just having fun and sharing the stoke, something that can get lost in translation with the pressure and expectation that competitive surfing brings.

Even more so when three letters are the base of them all and the name of one. Forget about keeping them straight when that one storm goes through enough stages to use up all the names. That storm’s tropical cyclone Eta."",""It’s not uncommon for a tropical system to stay in the headlines for longer than a week but Eta isn’t a common storm. For starters, Eta’s only a couple of hundred miles from where it was on Monday, and only 500 miles north of that spot come next Monday. And from the way things look, only 750 miles away come the middle of next week. But it’ll take a serpentine route along the way."",""Watch South Florida’s surf build and weather deteriorate on South Beach, Miami."",""First identified last weekend, Eta immediately went into rapid intensification mode. The small and compact structure of the system allowed for very impressive intensification, gaining 70 knots in a 24-hour period to reach top-end Cat 4 strength (130 knots), tying Laura as the strongest hurricane of the season. Cat 4 Eta made landfall in northeast Nicaragua early on Tuesday, then steadily weakened into a tropical depression as it headed inland. Thankfully, Eta’s compact size kept the intense winds relegated to a small area near the eye — but the catastrophic rains associated with the storm reached out for hundreds of miles across Central America."",""Premium Florida Forecast: Dade-Broward | Palm Beaches | Treasure Coast | Central Florida | Volusia County | First Coast | Panhandle | West Florida"",""For days, the tropical depression and its associated moisture dumped feet of rain on portions of the mountainous region, including the Pacific-side surf zones. Floods and mudslides are responsible for over 150 deaths, most in Guatemala. Eta moved back into the Northwest Caribbean Sea on Friday, but the rains and flooding will be slow to subside – the recovery much, much longer."",""LOLA’s wave height animation shows Florida building solid surf through the weekend."",""In the next stage, Eta restrengthens over the ultra-warm Caribbean waters and tracks northeast over Cuba this weekend. No significant strengthening is expected but the system does increase in size before ending up over the Straights of Florida at the start of next week. The pressure gradient between Eta – and high pressure over the Mid Atlantic – builds onshore easterly flow and well overhead surf for Florida’s East Coast into next week. Unfortunately, as the surf builds the conditions deteriorate, with one positive/negative. Though strong, Florida’s winds are easterly for the weekend — there’s nowhere to hide but the direction keeps the drift and cross-chop down; you can even find a semi-clean face if you’re willing to battle the elements (higher tides can help sort things out too). But it’s going to be rainy. And windy. Tropical storm-strength winds are possible in the southern part of the Sunshine State over the weekend."",""Eta winds back around to the west, likely across the Keys or South Florida early next week. There’s a narrow window while over the Straights where Eta could strengthen, but models backed off calling for much intensification on Friday evening. There’s better consensus it’ll stay a weaker to moderate-strength tropical storm but less confidence on what happens into the middle of next week. The current forecast cone covers the entire Eastern Gulf on Wednesday. It’s not expected to intensify once it moves into the Gulf and could even dissipate."",""How Will Eta Help Your Surf? Southeast | Outer Banks | New Jersey | New York | New England"",""The NHC forecast track on Friday evening."",""The winds off Florida’s East Coast continue strong onshore early next week building even larger surf. Winds shift more southeast as with the storm in the Gulf and the high to the north sliding east. That chops up the healthy-sized surf even more, but it does open up some of the protected breaks. The Southeast U.S. sees their surf build larger next week too as the winds rotate around, better aiming the fetch at the region as well as increasing the local onshore flow. Florida’s Gulf Coast has to wait to see what Eta has in store next week but Panhandle surfers won’t have to wait on land. Those easterly winds set up days of ESE windswell for Pensacola and the western beaches — and in Texas too."",""With just under a month left in the official season, the Greek-letter Theta is next on the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane name list.

The Corpus Christi buoy (42020) is reading 12.5 feet at 10 seconds of ENE swell on Monday morning, which sets up plenty of head high to overhead surf in Texas. The best conditions are found south of the storm’s center, where winds bend more NW/W offshore for areas like Padre Island.

Even though the tropics settled down after Hurricane Isaias, the back half of August through the middle of September usually accounts for a high percentage of any tropical activity seen during a given year. This year is still ahead of 2005 (the most active tropical season on record) for named storms. Predictions point to that record pace continuing, potentially reaching double the activity of an average year."",""More Storms, More Surf? Atlantic Hurricane Season Looks Extra Busy"",""Latest Atlantic Tropical Outlook with Lead Forecaster Mike Watson"",""So, it’s not surprising to see another storm develop this time of year — but it was somewhat unexpected that it would happen this week, given the unfavorable atmospheric conditions across most of the tropical Atlantic. Tropical Depression #11 formed Tuesday evening over the Main Development Region (MDR), well east of the Caribbean, finally becoming Tropical Storm Josephine on Thursday. While the system is struggling today, Friday, the National Hurricane Center suggests the storm has around 12-18hrs to strengthen a bit before environmental conditions deteriorate and weakening commences. There’s good agreement on the system tracking north of the Leeward Islands this weekend, but it looks increasingly likely that the storm will eventually open up into a tropical wave by early to mid next week, if not sooner. The longer Josephine can hang on, the better it is for surf prospects along the East Coast."",""No Tropics Needed — Weekend Waves for Northeast U.S."",""The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center."",""The Good"",""The Bad"",""Swell from Josephine breaks Florida and the SE US out of the ongoing flat spell. Some of this is also likely to mix in for areas along the Outer Banks through the Mid-Atlantic region. Each ring on this chart is one day of travel time based on a swell period of 10 seconds. You can find this chart here or look under ‘Advanced Charts’ in your forecast region."",""Almost all of the computer models show a quickly weakening system as it tracks north of the Leeward Islands over the weekend, eventually dissipating to the east of the Bahamas. This weaker outcome would still send a modest pulse of swell to the southern half of the East Coast next week — the NHC’s forecast of a slightly stronger system for a little longer period of time would send a notch bigger and longer-lasting swell."",""Expert Forecasts: North-Central Florida | South Florida | Southeast | VB-Outer Banks"",""At the very least, Florida, the Southeast, and the southern Outer Banks see a bump of SE/ESE swell early next week from the winds enhanced between Atlantic high pressure and the northern side of the storm. It won’t be a swell that’s remembered for years, or likely even next month, but it’ll break some zones out of a stretch of basically flat surf. Also along the Outer Banks the Josephine swell will mix in with a bit of NE/ENE swell from the low pressure system that may develop into Kyle over the coming days in the Northwest Atlantic. Further up into the Northeast there will be a bit of SE swell from Josephine in the mix but the local windswell will be the dominant source of surf next week."",""The time of year when things get interesting — on the way to a peak in early September.

6006aeec349a6870be3cee43,"Welcome to the Party, Tropical Storm Kyle","[""Quickly access the spots you care about most."",""The National Hurricane Center decided to get the weekend started right on time and dropped Tropical Storm Kyle on us with Friday’s 5pm update. In what has become a theme so far this year, Kyle looks to remain a modest tropical storm but does break the record for the earliest we’ve ever seen the “K” storm in the Atlantic. The previous record was held by Katrina in 2005. Obviously Kyle won’t have nearly the impact Katrina did 15 years ago, but it will send waves back to the East Coast, especially the Outer Banks northward, over the weekend and into next week. Forecast model guidance suggests down the road, after the system eventually undergoes extratropical transition, it will be a potentially significant swell producer for some spots on the other side of the Atlantic basin next week."",""Forecast track of Tropical Storm Kyle from the National Hurricane Center."",""Even though Tropical Storm Kyle will be moving away from the East Coast, which isn’t a positive for us from a swell production standpoint, the storm looks to work in tandem with high pressure centered over the Canadian Maritimes to put a nice area of NE/ENE winds over the Northwest Atlantic. Those winds put rising surf in the water for the Mid Atlantic through Long Island on Saturday — conditions don’t look great but there should be the most surf we’ve seen since Isaias blew through. Swell also looks to filter into parts of New England later Saturday but again with some condition concerns. I’d also keep an eye on Virginia Beach and the Northern Outer Banks at the end of the day on Saturday for the leading edge of the swell to start to filter in."",""Expert Forecast Analysis: VB-OBX | NJ | Long Island| New England"",""Sunday is looking interesting for Virginia Beach down through the Outer Banks — the NE/ENE swell looks to fill in and we may potentially see light winds and decent conditions. Onshore winds again persist for the Mid Atlantic while Long Island sees sideshore conditions on Sunday but there should be chunky surf around if you don’t mind hunting for a good one amongst the bump and chop. Lingering swell from Kyle looks likely early next week when an additional low pressure system that looks to move off the Northeast US also adds some surf to the mix. And, don’t forget Josephine which will put a bit of SE/ESE swell in the water next week too."",""TS Kyle: The Good"",""TS Kyle: The Bad"",""LOLA wave height forecast for Sunday showing the swell generated by Kyle in the Northwest Atlantic and Josephine north of the islands."",""Fighting to remain a tropical storm in the face of increasing upper level wind shear"",""Major hurricane moves ashore in same location as Major Hurricane Eta"",""Former Cat 4 hurricane leaves catastrophic wake, ends up in Gulf next week"",""After a quiet spell, the Atlantic hurricane season picks back up"",""Storm slams Nova Scotia and sends U.S. East Coast biggest swell of season"",""Swell pours in as storm recurves, tracks away from land""]","[""2020 atlantic hurricane season""]"

Common in newer zippered suits."",""Beavertail\nEarly wetsuit design in the ’70s that had a large flap affixed to the suit’s lower back wrapped under the crotch and secured in front. Designed to hold the suit in place, the innovation didn’t really work and surfers took to letting the slab dangle. (Hence the term, “tail”.)"",""Blindstitched\nSeam that’s glued together, then sewn halfway through the material so you don’t see the stitching on the other side; generally on higher-end suits and considered flexible, fairly watertight and durable."",""Double blindstitched\nSeam is glued together and blindstitched on the outside, turned inside-out and blindstitched on the inside; considered a very watertight seal."",""Expanded Seam Technology (EST)\nDeveloped by a skin graft specialist in the late ’90s, EST is a way to have a “stitchless” suit by weaving the panels together in hexagonal patterns; touted a few years back as the next giant thing, now mainly used in super cold water suits."",""Flatstitched: (flatlocked)\nSeams which have the stitching sewn through the material; generally usually used in warmer-water suits because –though it’s super flexible — it does let water through."",""Fullsuit\nAs the name implies, a wetsuit that covers the whole body. (Though some companies make short-arm fullsuits) Ranges in thickness from 2mm to 6mm, but the most common fullsuits are 3/2mm and 4/3mm. (Called “steamer” in Australia.)"",""Gaskets\nThree areas on a suit — wrist, ankle and neck — where the rubber is rolled inwards to create a fairly inflexible seal, which inhibits water seepage. The neck in particular is a delicate balance between flexibility and tightness, seepage and breathing. Some companies no longer use gaskets, relying instead on form-fitting rubber."",""Gusset\nThe panel that runs down the arm, invented to make paddling easier."",""Hood\nGenerally made of super soft neoprene, as it needs to fit snugly; can cover up to just under the nose in ultra coldwater suits. Hoods can come attached to the suit (some companies feature snap on/off detachable hoods), attached to some kind of nylon or polypropelene rashguard, or on their own."",""Jersey\nThe molded inner material that holds the neoprene together, made from any combo of polypropelene, nylon, titanium, etc."",""Kneepads\nOften made of slightly harder rubber than the rest of the suit to protect neoprene from constant duckiving pressure. Many suits feature molded kneepads, which are pre-formed rubber that ostensibly helps with flexibility."",""Millimeters (mm)\nRefers to thickness of neoprene. Wetsuits are rarely all one thickness, usually using a thicker rubber in the torso for warmth and a thinner rubber in the arms and legs for flexibility. While thickness can range from 0.5mm to 5mm, typical suits are 3/2mm for cool to cold water and 4/3 for cold water. (One of the only metric terms in the surf world.)"",""Mini-back zip\nSmall zipper, often flanked by a layer of rubber behind it to prevent seepage, which was developed as a compromise between ease of entry of zippered suits and flexibility and warmth of zipperless suits."",""Neoprene\n“Discovered” by Jack O’Neill in the ’40s in the aisle carpeting of a DC-3. Wetsuit neoprene is ultra stretchy rubber made from melted-down petroleum chips which are blown into a mold — not unlike a waffle iron — that ends up 3 or 4 inches thick, which is then cut down to size and formed by a fitted jersey (see jersey). It is closed cell, meaning it’s made up of hundreds of tiny cells that don’t allow water to flow from cell to cell, which is why it works so damn well — one damaged cell doesn’t affect the whole suit."",""Nylon\nSmooth material, usually used as a liner/jersey, and to keep the neoprene from expanding and falling apart."",""Panels\nNeoprene is cut into sheets that are formed to various parts of the body and then joined together at the seams. Panel development is ongoing and fierce as rubber gets more and more flexible, fewer panels (and fewer seams, always a good thing) are needed."",""Polypropelene\nWicking material (ie, it doesn’t absorb water) replaced many nylon linings in suits in the late ’80s and is often used for insulating rash guards today."",""Seams\nThe connecting area between panels on a suit; one of the most important zones and the focus for much of new developments in wetsuit technology. (See: flatstitched, blindstitched, double blindstitched, taped, stress point taping.)"",""Springsuit\nShort armed, short legged wetsuit, often 2mm. Used in cool water. (Some companies make long-armed springsuits.)"",""Stress point taping\nGluing tape is cut into small pieces and placed on seams in various pressure points throughout the suit, such as at the elbows, knees, and under the arms. The goal is to provide durability where necessary while keeping as much flexibility as possible."",""Superstretch\n(ultrastretch, highstretch etc) Trade name referring to a particular brand’s most flexible rubber. Often only used in high-motion areas (ie, the shoulders) as it’s generally considered less warm and durable than other kinds of neoprene. (This changes dramatically from year to year; what was last year’s superultrahigh stretch is this year’s boring old neoprene.)"",""Taped seams\nNylon tape is glued along the seams, covering up whatever stitching exists. Long considered a necessary evil to keep water out and add strength to the seams; often now only used at specific pressure points (see stress point taping) or replaced by liquid seam tape, a more flexible and perhaps equally durable option."",""Titanium\nA soft metal occasionally weaved into neoprene as early as ’91, supposedly to reflect heat back to the wearer."",""Velcro\nPatented hook and loop fastener, used mainly in zipperless suits to connect overlapping panels and in zippered suits to tighten neck gasket."",""Warranty\nDepends on manufacturer; often one year on materials and lifetime on seams, but as suits get more flexible, many only last one season before they start falling apart. (Most surfers balk at the pricetag, but end up feeling like it’s a worthwhile tradeoff because they’re so damn warm and flexible.) Make sure to send in the little warranty card to validate the thing."",""Zipperless\nOften considered the “holy grail” of wetsuits, as zippers — no matter how tightly made — will always let water through. Invented in ’89 by Body Glove, the first zipperless wetsuits were actually way too stiff for surfers to use; by ’93, the Japanese came out with another model that was still too stuff, but by ’95, most wetsuit companies offered a high end zipperless suit. Advantages include flexibility and warmth; disadvantages include short lifespan (due to super stretchy rubber) and difficult entry/exit.

The Hypto Krypto is what they call “the most versatile shape in the Haydenshapes range, enabling it to be ridden in waves from 1ft to 8ft.” It paddles well and goes fast, and probably most famously, has been ridden with timeless style by Craig Anderson at very solid Desert Point and G-Land (on a 5’4″ no less).

Evil pattern. Anyway. Probably gave it 30 solid sessions."",""I then put the suit into storage over summer and haven’t worn it since early Nov ’19.

Got it out now because you can sniff the coming weather changes."",""The suit is in perfect condition. Not even minor wear or chafing marks. I kind of half expected some issues with it, especially where the single sided neoprene around the upper chest and arms connects with the double sided stuff, I wondered if there might be some minor tearing along that seam, but it never happened or even looked like happening.

The drumlines, which have been responsible for catching and tagging nearly 350 great white sharks in the area, weren’t going anywhere."",""But the trigger was real for surfers who heard this rumour. “People are still twitchy about this stuff,” long time Lennox surfer/shaper Phil Myers told us. “They’re (sharks) not going away.”"",""Exactly how the drumlines have changed things as far as human/shark interactions go is open to question. Unlike meshing, they’re set to attract just the big three prey species — bull, tiger and white — and rarely kill their captives. Instead, contract fishos take the sharks off the hook, tag them, and release well offshore."",""Tag data has shown that following this process, whites in particular are slow to return to close coastal waters."",""Maybe this has something to do with why there’s been such a big decrease in attacks in the area since the drumlines were installed."",""But what if it hasn’t? What if it’s as much to do with how the humans are behaving?"",""A recent study has taken a look at just that."",""The study, funded through the NSW Shark Management Strategy and conducted by a UTS team led by social scientist Nick McClean, examined how people made decisions about whether to go in the water or not, given the shark presence and recent history in the area. It involved 60 people in four workshops in Ballina, Byron and Lismore, and included a range of people, from the highly interested and informed to the casual beachgoer."",""It also seems to be the only one of its kind in the world — pretty amazing when you consider the subject matter."",""“Everyone is the study is making a choice,” says Nick. Go in the water? Don’t? Wait till later?"",""The study revealed several different groups, with different risk tolerances, and different reasons for making their minds up about the issue. Family beachgoers were most influenced by the safety measures they could see in action: lifeguard patrols, signage, numbers of other people in the water, the presence of drones. Young surfers and swimmers were reliant on the example of others: if their friends were out or not, or what an older relative might have explained to them."",""Experienced surfers relied on their own judgement and observation, and their sense of what human/shark interaction might mean. Was it always a threat, or was there an element of co-existence? And, well, was it pumping?"",""Nick says he was “interested in what happens in the moment, when people make that choice.”"",""“A big part of it comes down to a personal understanding of the risks. The most common thing is that an alarm sounds and some surfers don’t come out of the water, and then there’s other people’s reactions to that. The reaction might be, ‘You’re not doing the right thing,’ ‘You’re being careless,’ or ‘You’re putting people in danger.’”"",""“But in a lot of cases the surfers are not just blindly saying, ‘I don’t care.’ They’re looking around, weighing up multiple factors, and making a call based on their experiences.”"",""Importantly, the study found distinct changes in behaviour across the range. People in the workshops were on the lookout for all sorts of things: weather conditions (ie. “spooky days”) when shark activity might be more apparent, information on shark locations, lifeguard presence, and the number of fellow surfers in the water. (“I’ll only surf in a group now,” was one response quoted by the study. You know behaviour’s changed when surfers like crowds.)"",""If you’ve been surfing forever, you might think, “Well duhh! People act differently about going in the water when there’s sharks!”"",""But this is part of how governments make their own decisions, about how to best deal with such issues, where there’s a wide range of thought and opinion on a subject — not to mention a fair degree of emotion. They need data to justify those decisions."",""Nick says there’s a lot of literature about human/wildlife contact in other places — India, for example, where tigers and elephants confront villagers in full-contact battles for territory. Sharks versus surfers? Plenty of anecdote, but as mentioned above, almost no study."",""This might be the first step on an interesting road.

6006af67349a6870be3cee55,100 Days Summer: Sunscreen,"[""Quickly access the spots you care about most."",""Originally published: 6/4/2010"",""More than one million people are found to have skin cancer each year in the U.S., amounting roughly to one person in 300. In Australia, which has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, the incidence is a staggering one in 50, with about 430,000 new cases diagnosed each year — and the numbers are growing. True, most of those are not the most lethal form, melanoma, which accounts for some 69,000 new cases in America and 10,000 in Australia each year, and it may be that increasing numbers are a result of growing popular awareness about skin cancers and more frequent medical screenings for them. The two other forms of skin cancer, squamous cell and basal cell, are less dangerous than melanoma, but basal cell carcinoma can become life-threatening if not caught early and treated. In all cases, however, excising the c-beast can be a disturbing and in some cases, disfiguring process."",""The statistics clearly show the importance of taking steps to prevent becoming one more case in the first place, and that means protecting against harmful ultra violet (UV) radiation — also known (not quite correctly) as sunshine — by far and away the biggest culprit in causing skin cancer. In brief, stay indoors and away from the window. Or if you must go outside and go surfing (and we know you must), use sunscreen. But that’s where things get complicated, because not all sunscreens are created equal. And unless you have degrees in chemistry and dermatology the label may not help make things any clearer. What’s more, interpretations of scientific research on skin cancer and sunscreen are sometimes contradictory. And then there’s marketing hype to decipher. All that said, choosing the right kind of sunscreen and using it in the most effective way can make a huge difference in how much protection you’re getting. This article is intended to cut through some of that confusion."",""What is ultra violet (UV) radiation?\nAbout 93 million miles from earth is a huge ball of exploding gasses we call the sun. What’s going on out there is actually a nuclear reaction, kinda like when an H-bomb go off, but on a constant and massive scale. The energy released radiates out into the solar system and arrives here in the form of light and heat, among other things. Some of those other things are various wavelengths of UV radiation. When light from the sun is split, using a prism for example, or refracted in water droplets during a rain shower, we can actually see some of the wavelengths of light as the colors of the rainbow. The longest wavelengths appear to the eye as red and orange while the shortest, at the other end of the rainbow spectrum, look indigo and violet. But beyond that are wavelengths that the human eye can’t see at all but are also part of that solar energy constantly flowing our way."",""UV light is the name given to some of that invisible radiation energy and it’s powerful stuff. While some is essential to us in producing vitamin D, particularly important for healthy bones, in large doses it can wreak havoc on skin cells, resulting in burns, wrinkles and bodies that look like worn out, old brown leather boots. UV radiation is also proven to be the root cause of most skin cancer. Oh, and it is always streaming down, even when it’s overcast, cloudy or foggy, because it easily penetrates water in liquid or vapor form. Some wavelengths of UV can penetrate glass too, unless it’s specially coated — remember that when you’re next on surfari in your vehicle, feeling cool with the AC and stereo cranked up, but with the sun beating down on your face through the side window."",""Much scientific research has been given to UV because it is so important to life in both positive and negative ways. Today scientists break down the UV spectrum into three main groups according a range of wavelengths from longest to shortest — UVA, UVB and UVC — and each of them has a distinctly different impact on skins cells and, subsequently, on the formation of the different kinds of skin cancer. They’ve also had a profound effect on the way modern sunscreens are formulated. Although some sunscreens advertise protection against UVC rays — and those have been identified as causing severe sunburn at high altitudes — we will not be concerned with them in this surfing-oriented overview: almost all UVC energy is filtered out by the earth’s atmosphere long before it reaches sea level."",""READ: A Surfer’s Guide to Avoiding Skin Cancer"",""So, what are sunscreens?\nSunscreens or sunblocks (there’s no difference in those terms except to the marketing department) are gels, lotions, creams and sprays containing various ingredients that, when applied to the skin, protect it from the adverse effects of UV exposure. It’s long been known that being out too long in the sun can burn the skin and the first sunscreens were formulated to help prevent it or at least postpone it for as long as possible. Problem was that sunburn is caused mostly by only one of the UV wavelength groups, UVB. Although UVB is also responsible for skin damage resulting in squamous cell cancers, early sunscreens did little or nothing to ward off damage to skin cells by UVA rays that are now recognized as responsible for cell changes deeper in the skin layers that result in basal cell and melanoma skin cancers. Today, many sunscreens advertise themselves as “broad spectrum” products, meaning they offer protection against both UVA and UVB."",""All sunscreens, regardless, carry a rating number on the bottle or tube expressed as an SPF (sun protection factor) number. Before we delve into the chemistry of the different kinds of sunscreen, it’s useful to understand what that really means."",""Alright, what is an SPF number and why is it important?\nHere’s a succinct medical definition of SPF: “scale for rating the level of sunburn protection in sunscreen products.” Nice, so what does that mean? SPF is supposed to tell you how much longer you can stay in the sun without burning. Since SPF ratings range from 2 to 100, it’s a useful place to start. It tells you, for example, that SPF X sunscreen should allow you to spend X times more time in the sun before you start to burn."",""But do not assume that SPF 30 is twice as effective as SPF 15, or that SPF 50 would be way, way better than both of them. For one thing, SPF ratings are based on exposure only to UVB rays — the kind that burn — and during the indoor research testing that established the SPF scale, that was defined as “a reddening of the skin” in conditions that were designed to replicate exposure to “the noonday sun.” That may be fine, but the scale leaves it up to you to decide how effective a sunscreen might be if you don’t already know how long you take to burn, or whether you’re in the Mentawais or Nova Scotia at the time, and that can make a big difference."",""Nor does an SPF number tell you how much sunscreen you should apply or where to put it. The Skin Cancer Foundation, an excellent resource for all kinds of information on sunscreens, recommends a full ounce (minimum SPF 15) should be used by person of average size going out and about in boardshorts or bikini — about a shot glass full. Think about it. The average tube of sunscreen contains four ounces; larger ones contain eight or 10. Many of the smaller carry-around tubes are only 1.5 ounces. Those promotional giveaway packets they hand out at surf contests? About one-third of an ounce–so take three! And get this, a 2006 study conducted by a team at the University of California, Riverside, found that sunscreen needs to be reapplied within two hours in order to remain effective. We’ll revisit that nugget when we look at the chemistry of sunscreen. Meanwhile, the Skin Cancer Foundation suggests using four ounces during a day at the beach, with the first application made 15 to 20 minutes before sun exposure. Now, who really does that? C’mon, fess up, not you, eh?"",""But back to the SPF scale. Again, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, SPF 15 blocks about 93 percent of UVB, SPF 30 about 97 percent and SPF 50 about 98 percent. See what’s happening here? The advantages of a higher SPF rating are minimally incremental and no sunscreen blocks all UV. In both Europe and Australia, regulators have put limits on how much SPF sunscreen makers can claim for their products, because they felt that the numbers were misleading to consumers. Even the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a 2007 draft rule has recommended that SPF 50+ should be the top of the scale so that sunscreen makers don’t get into a marketing contest based on ever greater SPF numbers. What really matters here is that SPF relates only to UVB, the “burn” rays, not UVA which causes deeper damage. To get the broadest range of protection, you’ll have to drill down into the fine print on that tube of goop and find out what’s in it."",""Meanwhile, what is clear is that using a goodly amount of sunscreen of a lower SPF rating, and reapplying it frequently, will provide greater protection that not using enough of a higher SPF-rated product."",""So, who’s most at risk?\nAnyone who spends a lot of time outdoors is at risk, especially those who are blond-haired and fair-skinned, and everyone who surfs regularly is vulnerable. While sun exposure in the tropics between the hours of 10 a.m and 4 p.m. is likely the most high-risk environment, even those who surf in cold water under gloomy skies get bombarded with UV radiation. And we’re not safe from UVA even in the shade. Here’s what’s trippy: the body has a built-in means of dealing with too much UV — a naturally produced sunscreen if you will — a pigment called melanin in the skin. This is the very stuff that makes some skin darker and, in response to sun exposure, gives a tan to those who are naturally lighter in complexion. The more UV exposure, the more melanin produced by the skin. Melanin works by absorbing UVB and UVA rays, converting the energy into heat. That’s nice, except that dermatologists will say that if you’re a haole with a tan, you’ve already done some damage. Black people have a lot more melanin than whites to begin with and it’s no coincidence they have lower rates of skin cancer. For a long time, it was thought that most cancer-causing sun damage was done in the first 20 years of life, and that may be correct since kids have a summertime tendency to stay out in the sun too long and get burned. But the fact remains that skin cancer appears to be related to lifetime exposure to UV rays and the highest incidence shows up in white males over 50."","" "",""\""Who Knows?\"" - Sean Collins and Nick Carroll explain surfer speed at Jaws."",""\""Who Knows?\"" - Sean Collins on the meaning behind LOLA"",""\""Who Knows?\"" - Harry Froebel answers attainable speed for a large wave."",""\""Who Knows?\"" - Mark \""Doc\"" Renneker  talks about what happened during Mark Foo's final moments."",""\""Who Knows?\"" - Jodie Nelson addresses whether it's safe to surf while on your period."",""New documentary showcases female surfers, divers, scientists, and more""]",[]

Is there a formula I can use? How fast do waves move?"",""Master forecaster Sean Collins replies: The Washington bouy (46005) is located about 400 miles West of Washington. As such a West swell that hits the bouy will arrive along the Washington coast about 18 hours later on the average. It really depends on the swell period. Swells travel at a speed of 1.5 times the swell period. So a 20 second swell will arrive on the coast about 13 hours later, while a swell with a 12 second period will arrive 22 hours later. The other bouys along the coast are Cape Elizabeth, Gray’s Harbor, Columbia River, etc. These bouys along the coast will pick up the swell energy as it arrives on the coast. There is another offshore bouy to the south, the Oregon bouy 46002. This bouy would also be the same distance offshore as the Washington bouy.

There it is, constantly in our pockets, awaiting our scrolls and likes and hashtags. But Oahu’s own Mark Healey lives in the real world, unplugged à la The Matrix. He’s in the sea – surfing, diving, and fishing. He’s on land – hunting wild boar. He’s in the air – or, rather, he’s breathing it in ways to help him in his pastimes above. He’s a man of the physical world in all its material forms; although his Instagram account is still a solid follow. Just sayin’."",""And one of Healey’s favorite side hustles – outside of his main muse, surfing – is diving. He’s become a well-respected free diver and award-winning spear fisherman, which, in an era when simply packing a bomb at Pipeline or hucking air reverses on repeat has become blasé, is important. You need to be more than just a good surfer to be recognized. You need to be an eco-warrior or a musician or a mixed martial artist or (in Healey’s case) an all-around “waterman.” And, more importantly, it also helps to have something else to do when the waves go flat."",""But the best part is, Healey’s hobbies help him when big swells do arrive. And diving in particular. So, for another edition of our ongoing series on cross-training, we picked Healey’s brain about what it’s like to go beneath the surface, and how it helps when he comes back to the lineup."",""600+ ad-free HD surf cams, expert forecast analysis, daily surf reports, video clips and performance data from all your tracked sessions.

Gabeira, Botelho, and longtime Nazaré stalwart Sebastian Steudtner have formed a safety coalition, called Nazaré Surf Rescue, aimed at preventing the unthinkable and ensuring the safety of all surfers in the water."",""WATCH LIVE: Nazaré Surf Cam"",""“As a surfer you think about what surfboard should I use, what equipment should I use – and then you think you’re safe, that’s it,” said Steudtner. “But it’s about what to do when things go wrong. It got us thinking like, if this thing happens, we’re dead. And if this other thing happens, we’re dead…really a lot of opportunities to be dead. So, it was time to think about safety seriously.”"",""To hear more about the movement, which started last November by the way, magicseaweed’s Jason Lock caught up with Botelho, Gabeira, and Steudtner. Check out their chat below."",""Steudtner, pioneering at Nazaré in 2015 (aka: the early days). Photo: Hugo Silva/Red Bull Content Pool"",""How’d this all start?"",""SS: When Maya drowned, Nuno, a lifeguard on the beach resuscitated her and he’s now our head of safety. It was lucky she just had water in the lungs and came back pretty quick."",""Anyway, we have a trained safety doctor who has started coming on the big days. He was always flying in on his free time and was a bit of a volunteer for five years. I was happy with that, there weren’t any crazy situations and we felt safe. Then came the WSL contest."",""There was a bit of a struggle to get a certain safety system in place. We didn’t want to have a separate safety team that wasn’t organized by us. There were three emergency doctors though, 16 people on the beach, nurses, lifeguards and it was supposed to be, by far, the safest day possible. And even with all that support around, Alex [Botelho] had that major wipeout. He floated to the beach and almost died. When that happened, I realized we’re so far away from being prepared for what we’re doing. We needed to be responsible for our sport, our surfers… everyone."",""Anyway, I finished that season and this really got to me. Not because I really like Alex – he’s one of the greatest people in our sport from all aspects – but because we had to take some responsibility. So Alex, Maya and I met up with the city hall at Nazare and some legal people and we decided to create the Nazare Surf Rescue Association which is dedicated to providing professional service during emergencies – for the entire swell season at Nazare."",""Alex and Maya, you know firsthand: how important is safety out there?"",""AB: Yeah, we need to have more safety here. Hopefully the organization will help with common education between the people who are first assessing a rescue."",""This association aims to gather anyone who is present or wishes to be present in any matter around safety in Nazare, to educate and train safety practices so we are all on the same page. I believe it’s a logical solution to increase safety and help avoid serious accidents in the biggest and most dangerous wave in the world."",""MG: The performance in big wave surfing continues to evolve but little has evolved in the safety of the sport, with lack of investment and time put into it. Nazare, being the biggest and most dangerous wave in the world, has the chance to lead in that department and it should."",""KNOW BEFORE YOU GO: Nazaré Surf Forecast"",""So, what does the safety team look like?"",""SS: We’ve got a full-time emergency doctor, two guys from Nazare and we’ve started training with lifeguards, the beach crew, fire department and we’re now rolling out training for the athletes. We want the whole community trained and prepared."",""We’re also going to get a development program on how we can improve equipment. One of the issues with Alex’s incident was that his vest wasn’t inflated – and there was no way to inflate it. In the air bag industry, everything is sensory controlled, so we’re working on creating a vest that is triggered from the outside and has different bladders. Also, little things like putting another handle on the sled so you can grab on better."",""\nWhat about educating others? "",""SS: Yeah, it is all about education. Nazare is this place right now where you can show up, you can go as crazy as you want. You can wipeout so hard and be a viral hit. And that’s kind of the problem. Our safety idea is not to be the police."",""There’s a lot of great examples around the world that have similar issues. Hawaii – they had a tow wave license to ride a ski. South Africa you had to stay for a season and then you could apply for a license. The first phase is to assess everything and bring it all to the table and sit down with the community, the surfers – it’s not our job to regulate and the police say it’s not their job, but we need someone to be safe."",""If someone dies, the question will be: why were they allowed to paddle out? What safety was there? All those things will be asked of the whole community, then there could be a move to shut the place down."",""READ MORE: Nazaré: That Was Then, This Is Now"",""Talk about the public training sessions and membership…"",""SS: We’ve got public training sessions. But obviously, there’s restrictions right now that’ll stop a lot of things. But there will be weekly sessions for anyone to come along to."",""We’re all sharing techniques too.

Get the newsletter, notifications, things like that."",""The third one is partners. It could be brands or any business that wants to contribute to our safety."",""For people traveling to surf Nazare, what would be your advice?"",""AB: The advice I’d give is the same for any traveler arriving at any place. Be respectful for the surroundings you have arrived at, observe it before you intervene, understand who and what (people, wildlife, landscape) integrates a place and respect them, and come with a humble and respectable approach.

Sort of like a “t” shape."",""But guess what? This picture we have is out of whack. It’s not what’s going on.

One of the only things you need to do to get there is a COVID-19 test 72 hours before you get there. That’s considerably a lot less of a hassle than, say, Indo with getting that special visa and the exorbitant amount of money.”"",""“For all those people who go to Tavarua or the nice surf resorts in Indo or other places like that every year, and they’re looking for that kind of experience, there’s really no other option right now,” said Sean Murphy. “The Maldives is really the only place. And in the Maldives, Cinnamon Dhonveli is one of the best options for quality surf, convenience, and consistency.”"",""READ MORE: Maldives Travel and Surf Guide"",""Photo: Dara Ahmed"",""For a full breakdown, here’s Surfline’s Jonathan Warren:"",""“Comprised of about 1,200 islands extending southward through the north-central Indian Ocean, there’s pretty much always somewhere in the Maldives offering quality surf on any given day of the year. However, there are a couple big climatology aspects with swell and wind to consider when planning a trip to maximize your chances of scoring."",""“These islands receive swell year-round, but expect May through September to be the most active months for more frequent and stronger pulses – the greatest chance for seeing some well overhead surf. This is due to winter storm activity in the South Indian Ocean being at its most vigorous state during that time of year. As the number and strength of these storms diminish in the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, the chances for a solid swell will dwindle as well, especially from December through February. However, you still have about a 50% chance for something in the ‘fun-zone’ (up to chest to head-high or so), but you may need to search a bit through the islands further south. Keep in mind that it’s not all about the winter storms in the mid-latitudes. On a more regular basis, short to mid period SE-SSE swells that spawn from high pressure near Australia are some of the best producers for surf in the region."",""“The other big factor to take into account are the seasonal, monsoonal winds. From around May through November (the wet season) the prevailing winds are westerly, often blowing from a more favorable northwesterly direction — at least for the majority of popular spots on the eastern side of the North Malé Atoll. Then from around the middle of December through February (the dry season) the prevailing winds switch in an opposite, easterly direction – which is onshore for most spots of North Malé. During the months between these two seasons – March/April and November – there will often be light wind and glassy conditions. In fact, overall, some of the best surf of the year will be during the shoulder seasons.”"",""TL;DR: The Maldives has waves year-round, but May-September is your best bet."",""READ MORE: The Maldives’ Five Best Surf Weeks of the Year"",""Photo: Dara Ahmed"",""“We often refer to the waves in the Maldives as ‘Indonesia lite,’” said Murphy “It’s a lot like the surf you get in Indo, but generally smaller. It’s really clean, crystal clear reefbreaks. The waves are generally not very thick. You should be expecting surf from waist-to-chest on the smaller size, to 10-foot faces with the occasional double-overhead swell.”"",""And there’s a handful of waves to choose from – the barreling righthander at Sultans, the rippable left pointbreaks at Lohi’s and Pasta Point, and many more just a short boat ride away."",""“There’s a bit of every type of wave – from rippable to barreling,” continued Murphy. “A lot of the waves offer both with super rippable walls and barreling sections. But the barrels aren’t slabby, gnarly barrels. It caters to a wide variety of surfers, so long as the expert surfer isn’t expecting Pipeline barrels. For instance, Gabriel Medina was just down there and he was ripping it to pieces.”"",""WATCH LIVE: Vodi, Maldives Surf Cam"",""Photo: Dara Ahmed"",""Of course, crowds everywhere have looked a little different during COVID. While your local spot may be seeing shoulder-to-shoulder crowds – everyone working from home = more time to surf – most international destinations, which primarily see foreign surfers in the lineup, have been almost empty. And if you’re staying at Cinnamon Dhonveli, you have first dibs at Pasta Point."",""“They have exclusivity and limited numbers, so it’s seldom ever crowded,” said Murphy about Pasta. “It’s 30 maximum. But because you can surf at any time of day, and there’s a bunch of other spots you can go to, in all my time surfing Pasta, I don’t think I’ve surfed it with more than eight guys in the water. The wave comfortably holds a dozen people when it’s working.”"",""Kurt Arnold, a Huntington Beach based surfer who was there in October, had it practically to himself:"",""“Normally they allow 30 surfers [at Pasta]. There were only nine others on the island. Normally there’s 300 people on that island. There was basically no crowd. Half the guys in the morning would take the boats to other spots.

But this savior of the Gold Coast surfer was only made possible by some fairly crude coastal engineering in relatively recent times."",""WATCH LIVE: Check current conditions from our Greenmount cam"",""Ryan Callinan, going left. Photo: Billy Watts | Lead: Dean Morrison. Photo: Andrew Shield"",""The Tweed Rivermouth has been the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the past 200 years, as vessels big and small struggled to negotiate the notorious Tweed Bar. And neighboring Duranbah Beach was known as a rip-torn Badlands, shunned by swimmers and surfers as impossibly dangerous. The danger led to the construction of large rock walls at the rivermouth to try and make it safer for boats to navigate in and out. The rock walls never really had the desired effect, simply moving the bar further out to sea, but they did transform the treacherous, windswept beach of Duranbah into an exquisite surfers’ playground. The shipwrecks continued unabated, however. Ironically, and tragically, one of the Coast’s best surfers and professional fisherman Bruce “Bucky” Perriot was killed when his fishing trawler slammed into the southern wall in 1977."",""Jack Freestone. Photo: Jeremiah Klein"",""The rock walls were first built in the early 1900s but were extended further seaward from 1962 to ’65. The extended walls funneled the unruly Pacific Ocean swells into the tight confines of Duranbah and compressed them into inviting A-frame peaks, while also providing protection from the prevailing southerly winds. The result was the creation of a surfing fun park with few peers in the world. While the Gold Coast is known for its long righthand pointbreaks, Duranbah is where local surfers acquire their fast-twitch muscle patterns and learn to go left. And where the points provide maximum tube time, D-bah’s ramps and wedges are the ideal training ground for modern high performance.  It is also one of the most consistent surf beaches in the world, with a surfable wave on offer around 300 days of the year, sucking in any remnant of south swell that struggles to get around the corner to those fabled pointbreaks."",""D-Bah, on the verge of maxing out. Photo: Andrew Shield"",""On small swells, the beach is packed with hundreds of surfers scrapping over the scattered peaks. At its best, in mid-range southeast swells, offshore westerlies and obliging V banks, three or four distinct peaks line the beach. On larger swells, the outside banks can provide serious big-wave adventure with few takers, and the Tweed Bar itself occasionally offered a rare, Indonesian-style left in the right conditions. Since 2000, the automated sand-pumping system has made the rivermouth safer, and ensured a steady flow of sand round the corner to the points, but has also spelt the demise of those elusive Tweed Bar lefts."",""FORECAST: Get the long-range outlook for Duranbah"",""The sand is always shifting on the Gold Coast, whether by the hand of man or nature.

The North Shore of Oahu in winter, the Goldie in (their) summer/early fall, California (and Europe) in the fall – you get the point. These are the times when scoring is pretty much guaranteed and, consequently, so are the crowds."",""But, like hitting the bar a tad bit before happy hour or going to a theme park on a Tuesday, some folks prefer fewer fellow revelers, even if it’s not primetime. And the same goes for shoulder season surf travel – you swap peak swell for less people in the lineup."",""KNOW BEFORE YOU GO: Mentawais Regional Surf Forecast"",""In the Mentawais, shoulder season is October to March. But take that with a grain of salt. “Shoulder season” in the Disneyland of surfing doesn’t mean it’s flat; in fact, there’s still plenty of waves and, in some cases, waves that might be more suitable for everyday surfers (read: those looking to get head-high tubes at Kandui, rather than absolutely pulverized at XL Bank Vaults)."",""As Surfline’s Lead Forecaster Kevin Wallis explains:"",""“While slower than the peak season of May through September, October through March can see some really great waves in the Mentawais. There’s a little something for everyone this time of year – the intermediate surfer will rarely be on the sideline for waves that are too big, while more advanced surfers will still find plenty of fun, rippable surf with the occasional relatively solid swell (with the best chance of larger surf in October and March). Wind, weather and overall surf tends to be best October and March, but even during the rainier of months of November, December and into January you can see periods of light wind and excellent weather.”"",""WATCH: Kandui Surf Cam"",""And “All Day” Ray Wilcoxen, the Kandui Resort Manager who has been holed up in the Ments during COVID and historic swell, agrees:"",""“Our Shoulder Season is my favorite time of the year. This time of the year, my eldest son Dylan and I froth out of our skin! Overhead, fun right-handers, and you’re lucky to see another boat to surf with. While it’s rare to see the triple-overhead Bank Vaults or double-overhead Rifles swells, you will see overhead surf virtually every day and the kind of surf that is enjoyable, not scary.”"",""Remember Anthony Fillingim and the Last Man in the Mentawai? The guy that got stuck in the Mentawais for six months during COVID-19 and scored massive Kandui, empty Bank Vaults and perfect Rifles? Kandui Resort originally brought him out in late February to show firsthand why they claim the shoulder season is the Mentawai’s best kept secret."",""For more on why shoulder season rules in the Mentawais, we hit up “All Day” Ray for five reasons on why it should be considered for your next trip."",""“Once we get into October the larger swells and SE trades winds start backing off and the winds switch back to north to northwest. It’s a big misconception out here that the Mentawais is like the rest of Indo and goes onshore. Our resort faces east, and we have a number of incredible waves that remain offshore during our entire shoulder season. Plus, the waves that take N/NW wind spots are swell magnets and it’s honestly never flat here. If the waves are super small, we always end up surfing shoulder-high plus waves and if you get a swell, you’re laughing since you have a lot of options and there’s very few people.”"",""Photo: Kandui Resort"",""“October and March can still have some people in our area but once you hit November through February, it’s very uncrowded. It still blows my mind that no one comes and part of the reason why we nicknamed shoulder season ‘The Mentawai’s Best Kept Secret.’ Our shoulder season edit truly shows what that time of the year does. You won’t find massive barrels, but you’ll be surfing overhead fun waves daily and you’re lucky to surf with another resort or boat.”"",""Photo: Kandui Resort"",""“The Indian Ocean really is a miracle. It puts out some sort of swell just about 365 days a year and it’s rare that a day goes by when we don’t surf. While most of Indonesia goes onshore, our area has a number of reefs that stay offshore. Big and barreling waves don’t happen every day, but fun waves just about do happen every day.”"",""Photo: Kandui Resort"",""“Shoulder season is best for anyone looking for fun, overhead waves with less people. Every resort/charter boat is different, but the majority of our guests are looking for exactly this. Some of the more well-known waves in our area (Kandui Left, Rifles, Bank Vault) are all very heavy waves and you need to be very comfortable in shallow, fast moving waves. The majority of our guests come this time of the year, give it a shot once, and then spend the rest of their trip searching for what is readily available during our shoulder season. It’s insanely frustrating to me, personally, since I would say at least half of the people visiting the Mentawais don’t want the heavy stuff, so there’s always a large number of people in the area searching for a fun size wave in the middle of peak season.”"",""Photo: Kandui Resort"",""“Once the waves go as small as it gets, that’s when the swell magnets turn on. Burger World is one of the best pointbreaks I’ve ever surfed and from Nov-Feb, the winds are typically perfect and there’s very few people to surf with. Burger World is especially incredible since the flatter the surf gets, the better the wave is. Nipussi is a go-to wave during this time of the year and it’s rare to surf with crowds from Nov-Feb. We have a couple secret spots that work super well with small surf and here’s a video of Donavon Frankenreiter from a couple years ago in early shoulder season. Donavan’s video is literally from one of the smallest days of the year. Once you get a small amount of swell, you’re surfing waves like Pistols, 4Bobs, small Rifles, fun size Bank Vaults, Pitstops and so many more."",""Restaurants comes to the Mentawais "",""Starring Morgan Cibilic, Mick Fanning, Tyler Wright, Owen Wright and more"",""Sick of mindsurfing yet?

And it wasn’t even anyone surfing."",""During the XXL session at Oahu’s outer reefs, a group of jet-skis got stuck inside when a bombing set rolled through. What followed was like a scene from the 1995 film Waterworld. Skis scrambled, some turning around and gunning it towards shore, others pinning it to try and make it over the avalanche of water."",""One of the skis was manned by South Carolina pro Cam Richards, with North Shore photog Ryan Moss sitting on the back, when all of a sudden the two of them got launched into the stratosphere. (Check it out at the 2:10 mark in the video below; Cam and Ryan are on the black ski.) Upon impact, Moss knew he was injured – at first he thought he might’ve even been paralyzed. Turns out, he suffered a fracture in his lower back."",""Cam, on the other hand, came out fairly unscathed. Here’s what he had to say after the incident: “Just to let it be known, we weren’t on that white ski, but one of the black ones. Just really happy to hear Ryan is going to be okay! I did the best I could do to keep us safe during the chaos and things just went wrong. I feel terrible for Ryan, but I know he is in good spirits and will be back stronger and better.”"",""While understandably rattled, the photographer is in rather good spirits, given the circumstances. Magicseaweed’s Jason Lock caught up with Moss at Queen’s Hospital."",""JL: Where are you currently and what’s the diagnosis?"",""Ryan Moss: I’m at Queen’s Trauma Center in Honolulu and the diagnosis is a 50% compression fracture of my L4. Also, some other minor fractures in my spine and ribs, but those are not serious."",""Walk us through what happened."",""We were just doing little loops in order to get into position to shoot. The sled on the back of our ski was broken so we couldn’t really reverse or idle. The whole morning was absolutely beautiful and insane. I had never seen waves like that on Oahu. I was mostly shooting stills and Cam [Richards] was doing an extraordinary job of putting me in the right places at the right time. Then that set came and really caught everyone off guard. I hurried to put my camera away in my dry bag and then I told Cam to just “go.”"",""\n"","""",""Lensman Brent Bielmann and longtime North Shore lifeguard Abe Lerner getting caught inside on Saturday — no rocket launching ramps with these two. Video: Brent Bielmann"",""What happened as Cam punched over the wave?"",""I just remember feeling weightless and it taking a really long time to come down. I didn’t realize how fast Cam sent us over the lip of that thing. There was no handle on the ski, so I couldn’t stand up and hold on and hope my legs would have absorbed some of the impact. So, I was just sitting on the back with a death grip on the leather seat. Next thing I know I hear a loud thud. It felt like the ski buckled in half. Along with that, my back sent a shooting pain and tingling feeling from my waist down to my feet. I remember saying, “f**k, f**k, f**k… I’m paralyzed.”"",""I legitimately thought I was. The ski wasn’t starting, and there was another wave behind the wave we just flew over. So, I rolled off the jet-ski with my dry bag, which had my cameras in it. I just remember telling myself, “I have to make it over this wave.” Luckily, I did without getting sucked over, but my dry bag with my camera gear didn’t."",""Were you just as worried about your images as your life? "",""Honestly, I was concerned about both. I still couldn’t kick my legs, and that gear is my life. I was fortunate enough that Russo picked me up on the back of his sled and got me to Bryan Phillips, who took me in to the North Shore lifeguards. There they were able to establish that I did have feeling and range of motion in my feet and legs. That was the biggest relief. I was one of those guys who’s guilty of being more concerned about their gear than anything else. But I’m 99% positive that if [other lensmen] went through this, they wouldn’t be."","""",""And who was on the white jet-ski that launched after Moss and Richards? That would’ve been North Shore surfer and media man, Mike Latronic — here he is reflecting on the experience back in the harbor."",""And what happened next?"",""From there the ambulance came and got me and transported me to Waimea. I guess during the transport process my fiancé, who was driving up with her sister, brother-in-law and niece, all saw me. My fiancé wasn’t sure it was me, but her sister and brother-in-law were certain they saw me. They didn’t tell her, because they didn’t want to freak her out. I was transported to Queen’s after five hours. I initially thought I was going to be able to go home, so I called my fiancé to pick me up. I was incredibly wrong on that. She’s been there for me through the whole process, which is nice."",""Had you seen the video by then? The coconut wire was immediately buzzing."",""Yeah, after I got to Queen’s and came up with a game plan with their staff, the rumor mill started swirling on the North Shore about what had happened to me. The entire surf community over here has been insanely supportive. People just offering help or whatever I may need."",""John John Florence from Saturday’s outer reef session. See more here. Video: Brent Bielmann"",""Have you spoken to Cam?"",""Cam reached out to me and I think he’s alright. I’m not 100% sure. In one of the videos, you see him get sucked over the falls with the second ski. Cam, if you’re reading this, I hope you’re all good and in good health. And thank you to Daniel Russo; the North Shore Lifeguards; all the Waimea and Queen’s medical staff; Shane Grace for trying to recover my memory card; and the crew that found and took care of my dry bag.

Its evolution now manifesting a large, complex and quasi stationary low pressure system south to southeast of the Tasman Sea and NZ."",""This broadscale low is working in conjunction with a big high pressure system migrating slowly eastward below the Bight: collectively supporting a vast SSW/SW fetch area that’s been responsible for the last three days of south swell across the NSW coast."",""Monday’s MSLP chart depicts the source: a vigorous frontal low now moving clear of Tasmania’s swell shadow and into our prime south-swell window. Source: BOM"",""However, we’re now seeing rapid acceleration in wave-growth inside our mid and long-range south swell windows; invigorated by an intense frontal low south of Tasmania now merging with the parent system. A satellite pass captured a core, 50 to 60 knot SSW fetch on Monday – initially aimed at Victorian and Tasmanian targets."",""This ASCAT image depicts core wind-speeds of 50-60 knots: the driving force behind several days of thumping south groundswell across the NSW coast. Source: NOAA"",""As the low marches further east over the next 24 hours we’ll see the severe gale to storm force fetch expanding in size as it moves clear of Tasmania’s swell shadow and into our swell window."",""Further, the system goes to work upon an already highly active sea-state, still evident in the wake of the leading area of low pressure that swept across the southern Tasman Sea over the weekend. That lends high confidence for a peak in seas and swell in the 40-50ft range, occurring over the southern Tasman Sea, just below the 40S parallel on Tuesday morning."",""Maximum seas and swell are projected to top out in the 40-50ft range on Tuesday, leading in an overnight peak in energy spilling over into Wednesday morning."",""Keep in mind the bulk of the resulting SW groundswell emanating from this source is directed further north and east (ie at NZ and Fiji) – and there’s little doubt both locations will feel the brunt of exceptionally large swell-event in the days following. However, that still points to a large and powerful southerly groundswell moving up the NSW coast: ramping up across the South Coast from Tuesday morning, before really kicking in across Sydney and Newcastle during the afternoon. For Sydney and locations north, it’s looking like the bulk of energy will move in throughout the evening and overnight, leading in still large and powerful surf across the region on Wednesday morning."",""True south-exposed breaks and deepwater reefs across Sydney can expect set waves nudging the 8-10ft+ range early on Wednesday morning, before levelling off at a still energetic 6-8ft+ during the day. Newcastle and mid-northern NSW coasts are likely to see slightly larger surf early, with the bulk of energy building in across mid to northern NSW coasts throughout the afternoon. Having said all that, it’s clear that a moderate onshore SSE flow will limit surfing options to the most sheltered nooks and crannies holding the swell, so plan accordingly."",""Data from our new Lotus model depicts a peak in energy across Sydney and surrounds early on Wednesday."",""The sheer size of the fetch area will deliver many days of powerful surf: transitioning from a pretty straight southerly direction on Wednesday’s peak, to a more SSE angle of 160 to 170 degrees on Thursday and Friday. That should see an exceptional day of surf on the Thursday and a still large and powerful groundswell is greeted by early light NW winds, trending moderate to fresh NE into the afternoon. Likewise, Friday should also offer up another full day of great conditions favouring south-facing breaks under a continued north to NE wind-regime."",""Ten Things from Surfing & the Internet on the Week That Was January 15 2021"",""Long-serving and legendary stalwart of Australian and Queensland surfing passes away at 82"",""The Most Core Surf Comp of the Year"",""With Sunset cancelled, Nick Carroll assesses the obstacles facing the WSL's planned restart in Australia"",""Helicopter footage of the biggest day of the year"",""Featuring XXL Jaws, Oahu's Outer Reefs and Waimea Bay""]",[]

He’s in the sea – surfing, diving, and fishing. He’s on land – hunting wild boar. He’s in the air – or, rather, he’s breathing it in ways to help him in his pastimes above. He’s a man of the physical world in all its material forms; although his Instagram account is still a solid follow. Just sayin’."",""And one of Healey’s favorite side hustles – outside of his main muse, surfing – is diving. He’s become a well-respected free diver and award-winning spear fisherman, which, in an era when simply packing a bomb at Pipeline or hucking air reverses on repeat has become blasé, is important. You need to be more than just a good surfer to be recognized.

"",""The thing about most sports is that you can practice as much as you want. The thing about big-wave surfing is that — most years! — there are only a handful of XXL swells. And even within those swells, only a handful of actual opportunities. And while working out, breath-holding and surfing regular sizes waves are all kinda practicing for big-wave surfing, there’s nothing that really replicates hucking oneself over a 50-foot saltwatery cliff. This year has clearly been a bit different, with weeks of non-stop North Pacific swell allowing the big-wave brigade to keep their guns finely tuned. And with Saturday’s Super Swell set to hit Jaws (stay tuned here for realtime coverage from Jaws, the Outer Reefs, Waimea and beyond) Thursday’s swell may have been just the lemon next to the pie — but it was still a great warmup, as Nathan Florence mentions below. Plus, as Surfline co-founder Sean Collins always used to say about a storm following the track of a previous storm, “it’s like preheating the oven” — mostly ’cause the storm is blowing across an already agitated sea state and doesn’t need to start from scratch."",""Nathan Florence, Jaws, 01/14. “It was a good day based one what we came for — warming up for Saturday and Sunday,” Florence said. “Get on your board and get the feet in the grip. Had some fun, big, tall north ones. Almost got a really good wave but the wind was pushing lips down and I got worked (see video below). All in all, ready for the next few days!” Photo: Aaron Lynton"",""Surfline lead forecaster Jonathan Warren explains a bit more: “A stronger presence of high pressure over eastern Siberia has forced the gateway of storms entering the North Pacific to a lower latitude — as it typically does around the turn of the year. A pattern where we see more developing lows step off Japan and venture out into the open ocean, instead of hugging the northern rim of the basin like it often does during the first few months of the season. This is a pattern that bodes much better for Hawaii to see more and stronger pulses of the generally more favored northwesterly swells. And with that said, this ideal storm-track has been set on overdrive the past few weeks with an above normal deliverance of lows entering the basin.”"",""Waimea Bay — Saturday is going to be a different story…Photo: Pedro Gomes"",""Warren continues: “In addition, we’ve seen another unique weather feature take hold in the North Pacific lately — one which has been working in harmony with the established storm track previously mentioned, like one perfectly synchronized machine. A large, complex storm has centered itself under Alaska. Meanwhile, the latest lows to spin off Japan have been getting wrapped up into the counter-clockwise rotation of this parent system — taking them on a more eastward to even southeast heading across the western-half of the ocean, all the while steadily intensifying along the way. Then just as they near Hawaii, they pull up and merge into the parent storm, one after the other and each re-establishing the presence of this Alaskan storm system.”"",""“The storm that delivered Thursday’s large pulse was just the first of a trio riding this Aloha expressway.

The storm track and location are the primary reason the islands only saw large to XL (but not giant) surf. Generally speaking, the lows were better aimed at the U.S. West Coast, sending what we often call ‘glancing blows’ for Hawaii. That changes this weekend."",""LOLA animation shows the long period XXL swell emanating from the storm. "",""A low in the North Pacific drifted off Japan on the 12th and explosively intensified over the next 48 hours, developing hurricane-force winds. Storms this strong have been a dime a dozen the past few weeks but what sets this one apart is the track. The swell-producing winds of the storm took a favorable east to east-southeast path toward Hawaii – not perfect, but it’s the best track we’ve seen for the islands in over a month."",""Mechanics of Jaws: The Science Behind Pe’ahi"",""The storm also moved at a pace and direction to develop a captured fetch. That occurs when the strongest wind remains over the largest developing seas for a period of 36-48 hours. The double icing on the cake? The storm moved over an already excited sea state (stirred up by the storm that delivered XL swell on Thursday) with the largest 50’ sea heights moving within 1000-1500 miles of the islands."",""The swell that started it all: December 2nd, 2020.

Look for surf in the 35-55’+ range with some square barrels on the west bowl thanks to that west direction and the long period. Breezy E trades are expected for a good chunk of the day before potentially easing late in response to an approaching front. Conditions mostly favor the tow-teams, but a few paddle-hellions will likely give it a go. Sunday morning, however, could offer very high-quality paddle conditions as the swell drops off but wind goes light with potential for buttery conditions."",""Here’s how the upcoming pulse might stack up against some of the largest and best swells of the last few years at Pe’ahi."",""The swell that kicked off this insane run in the North Pacific just over a month ago was the biggest since 2019. While the Pauwela buoy off of North Maui was unfortunately out of commission, from models and other buoys we estimate the peak swell was in the range of 14-15’ at 18-20 seconds. The incoming swell is expected to be around 20-25% larger with similar to slightly longer swell period. The weekend’s swell direction and breezy trades are very comparable to December 2nd."",""The 2018 swell has some similarities with this weekend’s event as it too worked off an excited sea state (the surf in Hawaii pumped for several days before the event, similar to this week). The real kicker for the swell that ended up too-big-to-compete in was the storm’s track. Not only did a captured fetch develop but the storm moved directly toward Hawaii. This resulted in the swell coming in above the models with incredible consistency – there were some legitimate waves in the 60’+ range as the swell peaked during the afternoon. The Pauwela buoy maxed out at 18’+ at 19-21 seconds. The weekend swell is around ~10% smaller with slightly less consistent surf than we saw back in 2018."",""It’s pretty cool that the upcoming swell arrives nearly five years to the day after the epic, El Nino-fueled swell of 2016 (one of a handful over an eight-week period). The Pauwela buoy topped out an incredible 19-20’ at 18-19 seconds on this swell for some of the largest surf of the last 20 years."",""High-Res Wind Forecast: Oahu | Maui "",""What made this swell especially memorable were the conditions. Jaws regularly sees side-offshore wind in the 20-knot or stronger range, but this day was different. A front passing to the north set up just weak trades and glassy conditions, allowing for Mr. Gold and others to paddle into the 60-70’ beasts. The weekend swell’s at least 10-20% smaller with much breezier and more challenging paddle conditions than we saw back in 2018, though there is a front moving through late in the day which could cause wind to ease."",""Updates from Jaws, Waimea, Pipeline, Mavs and more"",""Helicopter footage of the biggest day of the year"",""Strong WNW swells, periods of offshore wind in the next few days before the NPAC finally slows down late month  "",""Weeks of solid to XL surf starts up for North Shore, then Northern California"",""Here's where December 8th, 2020 lands, from the numbers"",""Nor’easter delivers solid surf and snow this week — more waves through the holiday week.""]","[""Jaws""]"

Ben Aipa (1942-2021),"[""Quickly access the spots you care about most."",""When Ben Aipa’s big heart finally stopped beating on Friday, January 15th after the man succumbed to multiple health issues including heart problems, diabetes, strokes and dementia, the surfing world lost one of its most remarkable characters — and in some ways, one of its least-appreciated. Not due to any lack of respect. Ben commanded respect without even asking for it, from the moment he first took to the waves at Waikiki as a burly 23-year-old. But he wasn’t exactly shy. No other three-letter athlete from Farrington High, semi-pro football player and blue-collar truck driver could get by without occasionally puffing a few lips — let alone learn to surf in Hawaii as a full-fledged adult. "",""Ben Aipa, power incarnate at Haleiwa, 1980. Photo: Jeff Divine"",""No, Ben has always received respect in full measure. It’s the widespread appreciation for his vast contributions to the surfing universe that’s lagged lag behind — as Ben’s name, while revered in knowing circles, is seldom included in a generic list of surfing greats. I believe this is because Ben Aipa remained such a vital, contemporary force throughout his life that he couldn’t be assigned to any particular era the way legendary surfers so often are. In the same way that his fingerprints have been on so many of our boards for the last half century, that due credit has become diluted. "",""Make no mistake, Ben Aipa was one of the greats; yet explanations to exactly what makes him one of the greats rarely point beyond what most regard as Aipa’s crowning achievement: the invention of the exaggerated-wing, swallowtail surfboard design in the mid ‘70s known as the Sting. That perception barely captures the scope of Ben Aipa’s high-points on modern surfing’s timeline; which, beginning in the mid 1960s, include becoming Hawaii’s first truly modern high-performance surfer who developed a bold style of carving powerful, full-rail turns in both big waves and small, on surfboards long and short, that by any standard would define futuristic."",""Ben, still on top well into old age. Photo: Zak Noyle"",""To get some idea of how prescient Aipa’s approach was, watch MacGillivray-Freeman’s classic 1972 surf film, Five Summer Stories. The movie features all the big stars of the day, highlighting guys like Gerry Lopez, Barry Kanaiaupuni, Jeff Hakman and Terry Fitzgerald cutting loose in North Shore juice on their narrow spears. Yet in a segment decrying the period’s tone-deaf competitive scene, Ben Aipa is shown surfing head-high waves during the 1971 Makaha Championships. While MacFree’s narration seemed to point to Aipa’s performance as an example of how competitive surfers must prostitute their art (this was the early ‘70s, after all), when viewed today Aipa’s surfing looks to belong to another era entirely — a more modern one that applauds the sort of nimble, powerful, figure-eight maneuvering on display. On a visibly thicker, wider board, Aipa seems to coil then spring out of his turns, accelerating up the face and then carving back into the curl without any loss of speed evident in footage of his contemporaries riding their parallel-railed pocket rockets."",""In fact, in terms of surfboard design, he’s been one of the sport’s most influential shapers. Not merely for the Sting, the innovative small-wave performance board that freed ‘70s surfers from the often restrictive grip of those sleek Brewer and Parrish pintails that worked so well in double-overhead surf, but also for the development and refinement of not one but two of the most pervasive surfboard designs in history, both of which you’ll probably see the next time you go surfing: the swallowtail; and the modern, 2+1 longboard."",""And he served by example on all of them. As a competitor he bracketed the generations like no other surfer before or since, having paddled out in a jersey against Ricky Grigg and Greg Noll in the 1966 Duke Kahanamoku Invitational at Sunset Beach, and against Peter Townend and Tom Carroll in the 1980 Straight Talk Open in Cronulla, Australia. Not to mention, hefting so many senior and grandmasters amateur trophies throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s that there were no longer any divisions left for him to win."",""Ben Aipa was simply the hottest surfer of his age — throughout every age of his life."",""Unlike so many other “surf stars,” however, Aipa’s contributions always seemed to be turned outward. Over the years Ben shared all his competitive knowledge as the sport’s first and most successful mentor and coach, guiding charges to finals berths at the 1972 World Contest and 38 years later at the 2012 ISA World Championships. Those surfers whose careers and lives flourished under his tough love span the eras: Larry Bertlemann, Mark Liddell, Buttons Kaluhiokalani, Sunny Garcia, Brad Gerlach, Conan Hayes, Kalani Robb, Andy and Bruce Irons, Alex and Koa Smith, and Bethany Hamilton."",""This maneuver should’ve been called an ‘Aipa’ from the start. Photo: Dan Merkel/A-Frame"",""In fact, upon winning the Women’s Explorer Division at the 2005 NSSA National Championships, only 24 months after a shark attack took her left arm, Bethany kept her acceptance speech succinct: “I want to thank God and Ben Aipa.” In that order. "",""Which is only proper. We should all be as grateful that, against all conventional wisdom, 23-year-old Ben Aipa decided to take up surfing. The big Hawaiian more than made up for those lost years with ensuing decades of unflagging devotion, commitment and imagination to the sport he loved so fiercely, leaving the surfing world so much better for having shared that passion with us. "",""Helicopter footage of the biggest day of the year"",""Featuring XXL Jaws, Oahu's Outer Reefs and Waimea Bay"",""The best photos from the another amazing week in Hawaii and California"",""Some of the best -- and scariest -- moments from one of the biggest -- and scariest -- Maverick's days in years"",""Grant Baker breaks down a less-than-stellar Mav's session"",""The incident involved a freesurfer on Tuesday morning; contest is postponed""]","[""Ben Aipa"",""Hawaii"",""r.i.p."",""shaper""]"

Select reefs on the North Shore see sets running around 30-45’+ on the face, while Maui’s Pe’ahi could push 45-55’+.
